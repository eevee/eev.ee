If you were not aware, I have a [Patreon tier](https://www.patreon.com/eevee) that's essentially: I will work on whatever you want for a day, then write about it.  I made the tier assuming that people would force me to do programming, e.g. actually work on [veekun](http://veekun.com/) for once.  So far it's been about half that, and half "hey try this thing you haven't really done before".

Last month, [@amazingant](https://twitter.com/amazingant) asked me to cook something, so I decided to [try making pretzels](/blog/2016/01/31/i-made-pretzels/), and half-seriously ended the post suggesting that he should have me make cheesecake next.

Well, guess what I had to do this month.

(Curiously, I _hate_ cheese, and don't much care for cream cheese, but I _love_ cheesecake.  I suspect cream cheese might be more a form of cream than a form of cheese; it even looks like an ice cream sandwich with the cookies picked off.)

Once again I turned to Alton Brown, the man I would trust with my life.  There's an entire Good Eats episode on cheesecake, culminating in [this recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/sour-cream-cheesecake-recipe.html).  Just like last time, the recipe as written skips a lot of the more interesting details that were in the actual episode.

Also like last time, Alton assumes I have a stand mixer.  Well, I don't have a stand mixer.  Why do you think everyone has a stand mixer?  I'm starting to think stand mixers are super great and I should buy a stand mixer.

So I bought [a stand mixer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UP2P).  By sheer coincidence, the cost of the stand mixer plus shipping was exactly the amount pledged for these two cooking excursions.  All told, it's kinda like someone gave me a free stand mixer, on the condition that I make two things with it and then eat them.

My lovely cat Anise helped me unpack it.

First, though, I need to make the crust.  And here I must make a confession.

I committed the ultimate sin.

_I modified Alton Brown's recipe._

I do love cheesecake, it's true.  But the cheesecake I love the _most_ is the Godiva™ cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory©®.  It's so good.  It's _so good_.  I have to carefully moderate how much actual food I eat when I go to Cheesecake Factory, lest I be too full to eat a comically large slice of super chocolate cheesecake.

Godiva's website does have [a recipe for chocolate cheesecake](http://www.godiva.com/recipes-chocolate-cheesecake/RecipeArticle16.html), but...  they're not Alton Brown.  Also, they seem to think a single regular-sized cheesecake yields 16 servings, so clearly they have no idea what they're talking about.

Their recipe calls for four bars of dark chocolate, so I went and bought four bars.  That's like sixteen bucks' worth of chocolate.  No wonder Cheesecake Factory is so damn expensive.

But what do I do with the bars?  Ingredients don't just add flavor; they have physical properties which they add to the texture of the food.  If I add a big pile of chocolate, do I need to take something else out?  Do they contain enough milk or sugar that I should cut down on the sugar or cream I add directly?

I don't have the foggiest idea.  I'm sure there's a Good Eats episode about this somewhere, but I'm not about to rewatch the entire series to figure this out.  I'll just, you know, wing it.

Anyway, I bring this up now because I also bought _chocolate_ graham crackers to make the crust.  Seemed appropriate.

----

The crust is pretty easy.  You need 33 graham cracker squares, which is a really weird number.  It's kind of a weird way to count graham crackers, too, since they come in 1:2 rectangles consisting of four similarly-proportioned pieces.

Honey Maid boxes contain three packages, each of which has nine rectangles, or eighteen squares.  Thus I needed two packages, minus leftover three squares that I ate as I went.

I assumed I'd be reducing them to crumbs in a food processor, but Alton Brown insists it's better to crush them by hand and have variously-sized chunks.  It's definitely a lot more fun.

I did notice that some of the chocolate grahams had a conspicuous sprinkling of sugar on top, which I've never noticed on regular honey grahams.  Again, is this going to affect the recipe?  These are not things I know.

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake2e-lottasugar.jpg That is a lot of sugar? %}

I need to mix some melted butter in here, but I also need to oil my pan with a bit of the melted butter, so I'll do that first.  Or rather, I'll do that second, after preheating the oven.

Let us take a moment to appreciate the terrible UI of my oven's temperature knob.  There are notches, and there are numbers, but the notches go _between_ the numbers.  Is 300° the notch before the label, the notch after, or the midpoint?  I assume the midpoint, and so far nothing has gone terribly wrong, but I wonder every time.

Alton has a creative method for cutting parchment paper to fit a round pan: fold it radially into sixteenths, eyeball the radius of the pan, and cut the folded shard of paper.  Unfold, and you have a hexadecahedron pretty close to the size of the pan.

Cutting the paper to go around the _circumference_ was surprisingly difficult.  I didn't cut anything resembling a straight line.  My paper was slightly too short and needed an extra patch.  And the sides of my pan are slightly angled, so I had to add short tears all around my strip to get it to stay against the sides.  I don't know if I'm terrible at kindergarten or actually awesome at it.

Once arts and crafts time was done, I mixed the cookie crumble with some butter and sugar, dumped most of it into the pan, tamped it down with a coffee mug, and tossed it in the oven.

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake3a-paper-circle.jpg Nice.  I quietly forgot to take a photo of the first attempt, which was slightly too wide. %}

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake3e-crust.jpg  At least it worked out in the end. %}

----

Now, for the filling.  I melted the chocolate in the microwave first, so I could somehow add it later.

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake4-chocolate.jpg It's just...  it's just so beautiful. %}

First I need some sour cream.

Hmm.

Okay, so.  I have big measuring cups for measuring liquids.  I have little measuring spoons for measuring powders and small amounts of liquid.  Sour cream is...  some kind of gelatinous goop.  How am I supposed to measure this?

Alton Brown has a neat sour cream injector gizmo, but alas, I am not a renowned television chef.  I had to fudge this a bit by spooning sour cream into a measuring spoon.  At least it came out easily.

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake5a-sour-cream-how.jpg Hmm. %}
{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake5b-sour-cream-success.jpg This is why I'm a programmer. %}

At last, I get to use the mixer!

The recipe advises running the mixer on just the sour cream for a few seconds — the idea is that the sour cream will coat the paddle and keep the cream cheese from sticking to it.  Sorry, Alton!  The cream cheese totally stuck to it.

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake6c-mixer-stuck.jpg Well, that...  kind of worked. %}

Meanwhile, I need to mix some heavy cream with vanilla extract and five eggs (sans some of the whites).

It is at this very moment that I discover we only have _three_ eggs.  I was fooled by the massive dozen-and-a-half egg carton in the fridge, and didn't think to actually look inside it.  Argh.

If I've learned _anything_ from Cutthroat Kitchen, it's that eggs are pretty important and nothing is really equivalent.  I had to run to the store and get more.

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake7-more-eggs.jpg I don't know why I took a photo of this. %}

Okay, back to whatever I was doing.  Mix that stuff, throw it in the mixer.

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake8a-goop.jpg Not very appetizing. %}
{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake8b-gooper.jpg Still not very appetizing, but a little better. %}
{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake8c-glop.jpg Eugh.  Looks like cottage cheese. %}
{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake8d-batter.jpg Aha, that looks more like something I could believe would produce cheesecake. %}

Anise, meanwhile, was supervising from atop the fridge behind me.  He was particularly fascinated by the loud red thing.

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake9b-anise-watching.jpg Whoa yeah that thing makes a lot of noise! %}

Hm.

So.  I have some completed cheesecake batter (which is delicious, by the way).  I also have some melted chocolate.

I guess there's only one obvious course of action here.

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake10a-add-chocolate.jpg Chocolate. %}
{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake10b-add-more-chocolate.jpg MORE CHOCOLATE %}
{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake10c-completed-batter.jpg That...  took a strange turn.%}

Something very strange has added here.  The volume of the batter seems to have increased _dramatically_, by far more than the volume of the melted chocolate.

It's also distinctly lumpy, but I don't think this is related to the chocolate; Marl says they're lumps of cream cheese, caused by adding the cream cheese while it was still fridge-cold.

Despite these curiosities, the batter is now _absolutely delicious_.  Extremely chocolatey, but still with some tangy cheesecake undertones.  It's not exactly the Cheesecake Factory, but it's pretty damn good.

The batter I have is now way too much to actually fit in the pan.  It's also kind of a mousse, rather than the thick liquid it's supposed to be.  What am I even making?  Is this still cheesecake?

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake11a-too-much-batter.jpg What am I even going to do with this %}
{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake11b-weird-texture.jpg This does not look like how it was on TV %}

I guess I'll bake it and see what happens.

A good chunk of the Good Eats episode is about how you ought to use a hot water bath to modulate the temperature or something.  But I don't have a Biggoron cake pan to put the water in.  And our oven is kind of small.  And I'm getting kind of tired at this point.

(I have a _really_ bad habit of leaning over slightly when I'm standing at a counter.  I've done it for as long as I can remember, and I'm not particularly tall, so it's not that I can't reach.  I don't know why I do it, and I usually don't even notice, until I've been hunched over for an hour and suddenly my back is killing me.)

So, screw it.  You will just bake like a normal cake and you will _like it_.

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake12-oven.jpg Look how comically small our oven is. %}

I left it in the fridge overnight, and...

----

I gave it a quick bath in some hot water, and it came out of the pan _really_ easily, thank goodness.

I had some of the crust crumbs left over, intending to add them to the sides to complete the crust.  They didn't really stick at all, though, and I gave up trying to force them.

I'd put the cheesecake on a regular plate, for lack of a real cake platter.  Cutting a cheesecake that has a big hole underneath it doesn't go very neatly.  Oops.

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake13a-done.jpg Done!  I hope! %}
{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake13b-plated.jpg Now on a plate. %}
{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake13c-crumbs.jpg This side crust is just not working very well. %}
{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake13d-lazy-cutting.jpg Oh my god what am I even doing %}

All told I made a bit of a mess of it.  And yet...

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake14a-slice.jpg Well, it looks like cheesecake... %}
{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake14b-delicious.jpg It's so good %}

This is a fabulous cheesecake.

Oh, wait, one more thing.  The Godiva recipe that I awkwardly spliced in asks for four bars of chocolate, but only three and a half of them are actually added to the batter; the other half a bar is reserved for garnishing the final cheesecake.  So here's some garnish.

{% photo /media/2016-02-28-cheesecake/cheesecake15-garnish.jpg Perfect. %}

I still have half a cheesecake's worth of batter and a bunch of crust crumbs, too!  I guess I could make...  mini chocolate cheesecakes in a muffin tray?
