**Difficulty**: fairly easy  
**Quality**: ★★★☆☆  
**Secrets**: 🍄🍄🍄🍄

I had three hours left at the end of a night, and I decided to use them to speed-map a Mario level.  Two hours later, I had this.  It's fairly simple and straightforward as a result, but still a fun quick romp.

The theme is fairly shallow: there's a "heaven" overworld and a "hell" subworld, and you shift back and forth a couple times on your way through the level.

I watched someone try to speedrun it shortly after I uploaded it, and I was delighted to see that they managed to skip the hell area entirely.  Seems appropriate.
