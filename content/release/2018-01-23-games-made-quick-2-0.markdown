I realize, with all the cognitive speed and grace of a cat falling out of a chair, that I have my own website where I can announce things that I am doing.

Here is a thing that I am having done: it's GAMES MADE QUICK??? 2.0, a game jam that runs concurrently with [Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com/).  The inspiration was that I once spent the _entire week_ of AGDQ doing nothing but watching the stream, which completely ruined my momentum and cost me the _following_ week as well while I struggled to get back up to speed.  What a catastrophe!

So my solution was to spend the week making a game instead, which prompted someone to suggest that I make a jam out of it, and so I did.  The results were [NEON PHASE](https://eevee.itch.io/neon-phase) and also the original [GAMES MADE QUICK???](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick).

It's a bit late to join now, but look forward to the jam during SGDQ, which runs the last week of June!  In the meantime, perhaps [peruse the fruits of this season's labor](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick-2/entries), or at least glance over [my thoughts on some of them]({filename}/2018-01-23-super-game-night-3-games-made-quick-2-0.markdown).
