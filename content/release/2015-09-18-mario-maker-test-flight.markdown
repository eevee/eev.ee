**Difficulty**: tricky, not in a good way  
**Quality**: ★★☆☆☆  
**Secrets**: 🍄🍄🍄

This is my first Mario level, hence the title.  It...  is not particularly great.

The concept was okay: you start out in what seems like a cheerful easy level, then you suddenly hit a wall.  You have to go down a pipe to progress, and surprise!  It's not so cheery any more.

Unfortunately it's a bit worse than "not cheery"; it's cramped and kind of annoying.  The original idea was actually _worse_ than how it came out — I'd intended that you have to cross the entire second area, get a cape upgrade, _and then backtrack_ without losing the cape.  You need the cape to reach the exit, so if you lost it, you were screwed.  I found out that you could actually skip all the backtracking pretty easily, and I was relieved enough that I left it in.

Suffice to say, I would do this very differently if I did it again now.
