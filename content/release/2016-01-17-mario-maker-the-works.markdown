**Difficulty**: fairly easy  
**Quality**: ★★★★★  
**Secrets**: 🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄

This is great.  I put a lot of effort into polishing it.  I even set it aside for a while because I wasn't happy with it, then came back and fixed it.

It's fairly long, but doesn't have any particularly tricky parts.  Pretty atmospheric, I hope.  Not all of the 1-ups are hidden, and not all of the hidden details are 1-ups.

I don't even want to say anything more about it; I feel like I'll ruin it.  Just play it.
