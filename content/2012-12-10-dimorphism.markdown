Today I went to the drug store.  I bought nail clippers, a nail file, and a nail buffer.  All existing nail clippers in this house have been transmuted into cat toys and subsequently batted into the void where lost cat toys go.

The cashier asked, with a knowing smile, "For your wife?"

Well, naturally, because dudes don't have fingernails.  That's why guys have all the jobs where fingernails would be a hindrance or hazard, like programming or rock-climbing or making more money.

I told him "no, for me" with a sigh, and only later realized that he'd think I was sighing at myself rather than him.  Whoops.

I twatted something similar last night, while looking on Amazon for lounge pants (which, let's be honest, are just pajamas).  The same category tree exists for both men and women, yet there is quite an obvious difference between [men's loungewear][] and [women's loungewear][].  Or even, hell, [men's socks][] and [women's socks][].

I just want neat abstract patterns in nice colors.  Instead, I get:

* Solid dark blue, solid black, solid dark black
* Plaid, usually prominently featuring the above colors
* Bad tessellation of a beer logo
* Stock artwork of Stewie Griffin saying something from a Family Guy episode that first aired in 1999

Y chromosomes must self-destruct in the presence of saturation, or something.
