Like many employed engineers, I get roped into the hiring process from time to time.  I don't actually screen résumés, but I do grade some code tests, and the résumé is sent along with it—in case I find myself desperately seeking an explanation for receiving five hundred lines of JavaScript arranged as haiku.

In glancing over these résumés, I've observed a pattern: I'm far quicker to judge the file extension than the contents.  It's easy to lie or exaggerate in a document, but habits are far more difficult to hide.  If you're the kind of person who reaches for Microsoft Word, you're still going to do that when writing a résumé.

I expressed this to Twitter, and not only did I get several people asking what formats I preferred, but I'm drowning in a deluge of suggestions for ridiculous résumé formats.  Let us collect some here.

(_Disclaimer:_ I don't speak for my employer yadda yadda.)

**docx**: What the hell is this?  Are you even a programmer?  I haven't had an office suite installed for years and I don't plan to start now just to find out what dumb school you went to.  I may open it as a ZIP and glance over the text nodes in `word/document.xml`; hope there's no important formatting in here.

**doc**: This isn't much better, and your office suite is ancient besides, but at least I can throw this at antiword and have a good chance of being able to read it.

**pdf**: Okay, sure.  I apologize in advance for the horrendous mangling your hand-crafted masterpiece will experience when it encounters everyone's HR systems from 1993.

**pdf with only glyph strokes and no text information**: Fuck you.

**pdf clearly generated from LaTeX**: Instant boner.  Are you sure you're in comp sci and not math?  Maybe you want a LISP shop.

**tex**: Hired.

**rtf**: You're either an idiot or as frustrated with the lack of light document formatting formats as I am.  But it doesn't matter because I still can't read it.

**txt**: NICE, as long as it contains either RFC-style genuine plain text, Markdown, or ornate Unicode box-drawing decorations with emoji insets.  Suggestions for appropriate monospace fonts a plus.

**odt**: This is still a pain in the ass for me to read, but kudos for trying, and double kudos for using a file format no HR department on the planet will recognize.

**ps**: Nice try, but I'm not a printer.  Cross your fingers and hope Inkscape gets it right.

**html**: There is something very fundamentally wrong with emailing HTML as an attachment.  If you're so familiar with HTML then maybe you should get, like, a website.

**xls**, **ods**: Allow me to respond with this chart of how much I hate you.

**xps**: You are out of your goddamn mind.  I'm intrigued.

**xml** + **xsl**: I've had [enough XSLT for one lifetime](https://github.com/eevee/project-euler/blob/master/heteroglot/014.xsl), thanks.

**link to a shared document on Google Drive**: It appears you work for Google and they won't let you have a real computer, only a Chromebook.  They're probably paying you more than anyone else can, so it doesn't much matter whether we make an offer.

**py**: Putting your entire program in a single file is poor form.  This should be a bdist egg.

**exe**: Acceptable _only_ if this is a crack for expensive obscure software released in the past 15 days.  I will also be judging you based on the sweet trance music that plays while it's running.

**swf**: Unless this is a vim swap file, get the fuck out.  If it's a vim swap file, you direly need to delete/recover some old files, and _then_ get the fuck out.

**iso**: I'm aware of precisely one [psychopath](https://twitter.com/kevinlange) who has created a disk image that boots into the OS he wrote and displays his PDF résumé.  No other form of `.iso` submission is acceptable.

**c**: [goddammit kevin](https://gist.github.com/4042963)

**jpg**: Now you're just fucking with me.  A text-heavy image should be a PNG.

**anything that 0-days my machine**: You can have my job.
