Eevee grew to level 28!

I'm a bit late; my birthday was on the 12th.  Oh, well.

I don't know what to say about 2014, really, so let's just start typing and see what happens.

* Bought the house, finally divorced myself of the old one.  Paid half of it off.

* I made some (one and a half?) ZDoom maps.  I first got into the ZDoom community over a decade ago — I found articles on the ZDoom wiki with my own edits in them from that long ago — and only now have created a map that's actually playable.  By which I mean it has an exit.

    In the course of doing this, I also wrote a bunch of patches for SLADE, the editor I'm using and the only one that really exists for Linux.

* I released a couple more tiny modules on PyPI: [cgettext](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cgettext), [classtools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/classtools).

* I actually got my dream roguelike, [flax](https://github.com/eevee/flax), to the point that it's playable.

* I started trying to draw, on and off, again.  I've recently gotten in the habit of doing a little [daily comic](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-comic), since my partner is doing the same.

* I learned Inform 7 and wrote some of a text adventure.  I also made a whole lot of aborted attempts at writing fictional prose for my partner's Flora universe; it turns out fiction is hard, maybe.

I feel like I've grown a lot, but I can't quite explain how.  I tried a lot of things I haven't really tried before, and they're all informing how I think about things now.  I don't feel like I have a lot to show for all of them, though.  Hm.

----

For once, I'm also considering what I would _like_ to do this coming year.

* **Write more.**  I only wrote six posts last year!  I blame this mostly on my emphasizing this as a "real" blog — I'm now unsatisfied with posting anything that isn't as long and informative as, let's face it, the PHP post.  I need to knock that off.  Back in my LiveJournal days, I once wrote a post every day for a month; perhaps another such month is in order.

* **Do a bit more with this domain.**  Ever since I bought it, I half-intended to also host separate pages for things I've made, and I don't mean just cramming them onto a single "projects" page.  I don't know what form this will take yet, but as long as the domain is actually my name, I'd like for it to be something that more accurately reflects me.

* **Finish a game.**  Probably not flax, but hopefully this text adventure.  It would be great if I had a website where I could host a text adventure, too...  hmm...

* **Write a book.**  Or at least a significant chunk of one.  I have a lot of ideas for a programming book (series?).

* **Make money.**  I have a salary from a "real" job, of course, but I would really like to prove that I could someday support myself with my own endeavors.  Any of the above are possible candidates.

Only five things in a year.  How hard can it be?
