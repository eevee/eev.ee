April's theme is **finish Runed Awakening**.

It took a few days to clear my plate and get up to speed, and I'm a little worried at how much time blog obligations seem to be eating this month, but I made some good progress.

- **blog**: I scrapped a bunch of manual thumbnails from git and finally switched to Pelican's thumbnailer plugin.  I also wrote about [my first computer(s)](/blog/2016/04/05/my-first-computer/).

- **art**: I [painted an Eevee](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/717037513810903040), and it came out okay.  I also did [a quick painting inspired by Runed Awakening work](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/718299110131023872).

- **Runed Awakening**: Aha!  Much like making a Doom level, the hardest part is just _having ideas_, and then having more ideas to fill in the details of the bigger ideas.  I've got enough big ideas; it's the little ones that are proving tricky.  I did manage to fix a _ton_ of bugs, finally add several alternative solutions for getting past the ███████, implement the ████████ ██ ████, add a new ████████ and an item that can ████████, and jot down some notes on future direction.  It's not quite a week's worth of work, but it's a solid few days' worth, and I feel like it's a big step forward.  I hope I can keep it going!
