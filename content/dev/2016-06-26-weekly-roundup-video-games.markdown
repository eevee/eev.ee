June's theme is **clearing my plate**.

- **SLADE**: I fixed yet another obscure geometry editing bug.  I feel a little more cleansed every time I do.  Also I found out that GZDoomBuilder based its own geometry code on SLADE's and almost immediately borrowed my SLADE fix.

- **art**: Still doing [daily Pok√©mon](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/746800017768218624).  The half hour time limit is surprisingly harsh, but I think I'm making some progress, gradually.  Also finished an old art trade.

- **runed awakening**: I built out most of a whole puzzle sequence that had languished unfinished for a while, and drew a WIP or two of some of the rooms and objects involved.  It doesn't sound like a lot, and I wish I'd done more, but I made some good progress.

- **zdoom**: On a total whim, I did an extremely simple [proof of concept of Lua in ZDoom](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/745010109282082816).  There's no approval or planned goals or anything for this; I just felt like trying it out.  May or may not continue it.  Ideally it would be able to replace ACS and at least massively enhance DECORATE.

- **blog**: I wrote about [video games]({filename}/2016-06-22-graphical-fidelity-is-ruining-video-games.markdown) again.

I think I ran out of _small_ things on my plate, and now I'm finding all the _large_ things a little daunting.  And here I've invented another one.  Argh.  Still, keep moving forward.
