April's theme was **finish Runed Awakening**, which I definitely did not do, but I am _way_ further along than I was a month ago.  Maybe by the end of May?  I don't want to set a hard deadline when I have no real way to estimate how much work is left, but I don't want to lose this momentum, either.  I'll keep y'all posted.  Hopefully by the end of _this_ week I'll have made a significant dent in some combination of Runed Awakening and May blogging.

- **Runed Awakening**: Implemented _padlocks_, woohoo.  Did some more high-level planning; getting pretty close to a cohesive whole here, at least in theory.  Drew a couple more pixel items.  Then, uh, kinda didn't touch it again for most of the week because I had Patreon obligations to take care of, oops.

- **blog**: I wrote about [dozenal]({filename}/2016-04-26-the-case-for-base-twelve.markdown) and [using Lua for game development]({filename}/2016-04-30-embedding-lua-vs-python.markdown), which somehow turned into a dissection of how to embed Lua and Python.

- **art**: I spent a couple days drawing after not really doing so much of it for the last few weeks, resulting in [some cat complaints](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/725485690448834560), [some cat revenge](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/726189551010471936), and [my finishing this ancient art trade](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/726285837801918464).  At which point two more people asked to trade, sob.

    Also touched up [my avatar for May](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/726622127080628224).

- **doom**: So there's a texture pack (Community Chest 4) that was really popular among DUMP 2 mappers, but it's some 13MB.  A good chunk of it is just translations or color substitutions of vanilla textures, which is something ZDoom can already express with a human-readable text format, so I started writing a script to detect and convert as many of these as possible.  It turned out to be harder than I was expecting and I kinda bailed halfway through.  This is very fascinating, I'm sure.

    I did also poke at anachrony a bit; still trying to settle on a set of weapons/items/monsters so I can actually go build some maps when I have the urge.

- **tech**: A friend lost some data from a web-based shop thing and I magicked it back into existence because I'm actually a witch IRL.

- **gamedev**: Having admitted I'd never tried [PICO-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) in the Lua post, I bought it on a whim and tinkered with it a bit last night, producing [this fine non-game](http://apps.veekun.com/eeveequest/eeveequest.html).  (I worked on it some more today, so [it's better now](http://apps.veekun.com/eeveequest/eeveequest2.html), but it's not last week any more so this doesn't count.)
