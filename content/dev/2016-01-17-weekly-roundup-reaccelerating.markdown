January's theme is **web dev**, and the major project is **spline**, the thing that runs [Floraverse](http://floraverse.com/).

Getting momentum back after completely blowing it all on AGDQ was surprisingly difficult.  I felt like I'd forgotten that I'd ever done anything and would never be able to do anything again.  After just a week!  Brains are weird.

- **art**: The [daily comics](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-comic) continue.

- **Runed Awakening**: Web dev seemed particularly imposing with no momentum, so I turned back to my game to get going again.  I actually made some really solid progress!  Implemented three or four new puzzles, added a way to see which alternative solutions you've found _even across playthroughs_, and fixed a bunch of obscure bugs.  Still a long way to go, but it'll get there if I can keep it moving along.

- **flora**: Yet another cutscene.

- **blog**: I dug up and finished an old [heteroglot post about Pascal]({filename}/2016-01-12-heteroglot-number-16-in-pascal-number-17-in-inform7.markdown), and threw in an Inform 7 problem I'd done in the meantime.  It was also ðŸŽ‚ my birthday ðŸŽ‚ this week, which called for the age-old tradition of putting confetti all over [veekun](http://veekun.com/).  I'd always used some ancient snowflake "DHTML" script because I'm lazy, but this year I rewrote it from scratch to use CSS animations and [only the slightest iavascript](https://github.com/eevee/eev.ee/blob/master/theme/static/PARTYMODE/partymode.js) to generate the markup.  Now it animates much more smoothly and is much less of a resource hog.  For a joke that appears one day a year.  Oh well.

- **spline**: Less than I would have hoped for halfway through the month, but I did clean up the (minimal) docs a little bit and replace a bunch of code with a third-party module.

- **Mario Maker**: Made [Purgatory]({filename}/updates/2016-01-16-mario-maker-purgatory.markdown).
