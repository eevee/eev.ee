As I said before, I was occupied for a bit, but now I should finally be able to get back to doing these weekly!  I did manage to get a few things done over the past three weeks:

- **flora**: Finished up and published a [Luneko species sheet](https://floraverse.com/comic/seeds/the-show-must-go-on/806-species-lunekos/)!  Happy April Fool.
  
    That's Anise.  Anise is the April fool, and also he's happy.

- **blog**: I wrote about [how the particle wipe generator works]({filename}/release/2019-04-20-particle-wipe-generator.markdown), in lurid detail!  I think it's an interesting little read, even if you have no use for the tool itself.

    I also spent a lot of time backfilling old art on my (clean) art gallery.  It's not updated quite yet; there's a _lot_ to go to, shockingly so, and I haven't even made it through year one yet.  Honestly, I'm kind of embarrassed by how much my output declined over time.

- **art**: Speaking of, I'm back to drawing regularly, instead of just saying I wish I were drawing regularly!  I think I've actually been drawing pretty regularly for like two weeks now.  Most of it is porn.  I should probably draw some not-porn, too.  It's just, you know, porn is a lot of fun to draw.

- **secret thing**: I laid some groundwork for the little game engine I'm writing and haven't really talked about yet.  More on that, including maybe even a name, once I feel like I have some kinda proof of concept.

- **sudoku thing**: I taught it about extra regions so now it can be used to play hyper sudoku?  I don't know why I'm even making this.  It's kind of unusable until I add undo/redo and puzzle generation, and both of those are effort.  I guess I'll see if my spite is strong enough to power me through both.

- **streaming**: Ash and I played video games on the internet while high and you can [watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwIbo7IVRQA) if you really want to for some reason.

Hey, that's not too bad a haul, considering I didn't even have time to work for most of the month!  Got some good stuff going on, glad to see I'm up to speed again at last.
