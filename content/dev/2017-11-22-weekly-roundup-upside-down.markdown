Complicated week.

- **blog**: I wrote a rather large chunk of one post, but didn't finish it.  I also made a [release]({category}updates) category for, well, release announcements, so that maybe things I make will have a permanent listing and not fade into obscurity on my Twitter timeline.

- **fox flux**: Drew some experimental pickups.  Started putting together a real level with a real tileset (rather than the messy sketch sheet i've been using).  Got doors partially working with some cool transitions.  Wrote a little jingle for picking up a heart.

- **veekun**: Started working on Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon; I have the games dumped to YAML already, so getting them onto the site shouldn't take too much more work.
