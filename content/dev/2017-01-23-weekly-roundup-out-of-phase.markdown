As is [tradition]({filename}/dev/2016-05-30-weekly-roundup-triple-monday.markdown), I skipped a week because I was busy making a video game with Mel.

The video game is [NEON PHASE](https://eevee.itch.io/neon-phase) and I [wrote about it]({filename}/updates/2017-01-21-neon-phase.markdown) and it's pretty cool.

Between that and our hellcats, I've been sleeping terribly again, so things are currently a bit of a slog.  I have so much to do.  Making slow progress.

Other than that:

- **blog**: I wrote the traditional [birthday post]({filename}/2017-01-21-eevee-gained-2611-experience-points.markdown) and the aforementioned [post about NEON PHASE]({filename}/updates/2017-01-21-neon-phase.markdown).

    I've also been putting some effort into re-revamping my list of work, since right now it's largely a wall of text.  Now that I've finally registered [an account on itch.io](https://eevee.itch.io/), I've been putting our previous little games on it, which takes a surprising amount of effort to do well.

- **isaac**: I've been cherry-picking the NEON PHASE work back to the Isaac HD codebase.  It isn't particularly difficult, just sort of tedious.

- **other game stuff**: I've been planning NEON PHASE 2 with Mel, and I'm thinking about doing another game jam for February, and I wrote [a little linear Twine](https://eevee.itch.io/watcha-got) under tight time constraints.

I've also been running through [the games made for my jam](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick/entries), playing a few of them each day, which is surprisingly time-consuming.  But several dozen little things exist just because I invited people to make stuff, and that's incredible, and I want to see what that stuff is.

I still need to get out a demo port of Isaac's Descent (argh) and finish loading SUMO into veekun (_ARGH_) and then I can get back to the...  three?  four??  games I seem to be working on at the moment.
