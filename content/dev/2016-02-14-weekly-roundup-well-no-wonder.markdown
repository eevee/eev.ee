February's theme is **writing**, and the major project is a **book**.

I had a strange week.

I've had frequent headaches since around the end of January, especially when staring at text on a screen for long periods of time, which has made the theme of _writing_ a little difficult.  This week, I finally went to an optometrist.  Lo and behold, my eyesight has worsened from 20/15 post-[LASIK]({filename}/2012-10-21-lasik.markdown) to 20/25.  One pair of glasses later, and the headaches are gone.  I barely notice the difference, but I guess teeny-tiny monitor text was just fuzzy enough that I tired my eyes out trying to focus on it all day every day.

I've also been a little disillusioned with drawing lately — it seemed like I couldn't even move the tablet pen how I wanted any more.  This week I discovered I'd somehow turned on the stabilizer (which smooths out your strokes), and it was high enough to mess with me but not high enough to be the obvious cause.  Whoops.

Not a great start to the month, but at least that's all taken care of.

- **art**: One or two [dailies](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-comic), though I've taken a bit of a break, due to eye pain and lack of ideas.  

- **spline**: Trimmed blog posts to the first couple paragraphs on the front page of [Mel's personal site](http://glitchedpuppet.com/), so you can actually see the buttons at the bottom.

- **Runed Awakening**: Dealt with some technical nonsense regarding touchability, which was satisfying but made no visible improvement.  Did a lot of planning.  Still feel like there's too big a gap in the middle of the game, but I'm very gradually closing it.

- **doom**: Playing with weapons again.  Looking for sound effects.  Experimented with improving function documentation on the ZDoom wiki.

- **blog**: Wrote about [UI changes]({filename}/2016-02-10-we-have-always-been-at-war-with-ui.markdown).

- **slade**: Worked on previewing 3D floors — mostly fixing tricky bugs with what I'd already done.
