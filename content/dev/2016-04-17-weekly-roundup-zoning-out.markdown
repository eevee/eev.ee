April's theme is **finish Runed Awakening**.

It took a few days to clear my plate and get up to speed, and I'm a little worried at how much time blog obligations seem to be eating this month, but I made some good progress.

- **twitter**: I installed Windows 95 in a VM and [documented the experience](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/719282027556511745).  I also wrote [a good Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/unicodeveryword) that tweets every word, distorted by some Unicode shenanigans.

- **blog**: I wrote [about emoji](/blog/2016/04/12/apple-did-not-invent-emoji/), at considerable length.

- **Runed Awakening**: Ehh.  I ran dry on major ideas and spent several days mostly struggling to drum up some more (or avoiding the question altogether, which is how the Twitter bot came to be).  I did end up making a _little_ progress, but not what I would call a week's worth.

I'm halfway through the month and don't have a whole lot to show for it, unfortunately.  Learning how to have ideas is...  difficult.  With Doom architecture, I at least found a trick for getting my foot in the door: find an empty space and just draw _something_ in it.  I don't know how to translate that to a text-based puzzle game where everything has to make a bit more narrative sense, which is a little frustrating.

I've had some more inspiration _today_, so that's good, but I'm going to run dry again pretty quickly if I can't find a reproducible way to generate new ideas.  I have a hard time just sitting and thinking in the first place, which is a huge handicap.  I've had the best luck when doing something tedious and purely physical, so my mind can wander, but I've never been able to duplicate the effect _deliberately_.
