title: Biweekly roundup: doubling down

March's theme is **video games**, I guess?

It's actually been two weeks since the last roundup, but there's an excellent reason for that!

- **doom**: As previously mentioned, someone started a ["just get something done" ZDoom mapping project](http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=51072), so I made a map!  I spent a _solid seven days_ doing virtually nothing but working on it.  And it came out pretty fantastically, I think.  The final project is still in a bug-fixing phase, but I'll link it when it's done.

- **blog**: I wrote about how [maybe we could tone down the JavaScript](/blog/2016/03/06/maybe-we-could-tone-down-the-javascript/), and it was _phenomenally_ popular.  People are still linking it anew on Twitter.  That's pretty cool.  I also wrote a _ton_ of developer commentary for my Doom map, which I'll finish in the next few days and publish once the mapset is actually released.  And I combed through my [Doom series](/blog/2015/12/19/you-should-make-a-doom-level-part-1/) to edit a few things that are fixed in recent ZDoom and SLADE releases.

- **veekun**: I managed to generate [a YAML-based data file for Pokémon Red](https://gist.github.com/eevee/b53b4babd7a0fc8aead7) directly from game data.  There's still a lot of work to do to capture moves and places and other data, but this is a great start.

- **SLADE**: In my 3D floor preview branch, [the sides of simple 3D floors now render](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/707341724973006848).  There is so much work left to do here but the basics are finally there.  Also fixed about nine papercuts I encountered while making my map, though some others remain.

- **mario maker**: I made [a level](https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/courses/14DC-0000-01ED-C104) but have neglected to write about it here yet.  Oops.

- **art**: I drew most of the next part of Pokémon Yellow but then got kinda distracted by Doom stuff.  I redrew last year's Pi Day comic for the sake of [comparison](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/709664240357933056).  I also started on Mel's birthday present, which involves something astoundingly difficult that I've never tried before.

- **irl**: I replaced my case fans, and it was a nightmare.  "Toolless" fasteners are awful.

Pouring a solid week into one thing is _weird_; I feel like I haven't drawn or touched Runed Awakening in ages, now.  I'd like to get back to those.

I also still want to rig a category for posts about stuff I'm releasing, and also do something with that terrible "projects" page, so hopefully I'll get to those soon.
