**Difficulty**: medium, has some annoying spots  
**Quality**: ★★★☆☆  
**Secrets**: 🍄🍄🍄🍄

I _love_ any kind of parallel-areas gimmick, and since you can make large versions of basically any critter in Mario Maker, it was begging for this.  It's named for a world in Mario 64, which I played only briefly but found memorable anyway.

It's surprisingly difficult to come up with puzzles that actually _require_ large monsters, and even harder to come up with ones that require small monsters.  In the end, I think all but one of the puzzles can be solved in either world, though one way is always considerably easier than the other.  I like alternate solutions, and heavily dislike when game designers add obvious artificial roadblocks to seal off alternate solutions, so I'm fine with this.

There are some places that are a little harder than they ought to be, which is a shame, but it's my most popular level nonetheless.  I'm itching to make a sequel, but this was _incredibly_ tedious to do, because you can't actually copy anything across areas.  All of it was done manually.
