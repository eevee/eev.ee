- **fox flux**: Cleaned up and committed the "heart get" overlay and worked on some more art for it.  Diagnosed a very obscure physics problem, but didn't come up with a good solution yet; physics is hard!  Drew a very good tree trunk to use as a spawn point; also worked on some background foliage, though less successfully.  Played with colors a bit.  Tried to work out a tileset for underground areas.

- **music**: I wrote like half of a little chiptune song that I actually like so far!  I'm now seriously toying with the idea of doing my own music for fox flux.  Played a bit with more sound effects, too.

- **blog**: I wrote up the [Eevee mugshot set for Doom]({filename}/updates/2017-11-23-eevee-mugshot-set-for-doom.markdown) I made, as an inaugural post for the [release](/blog/updates/) category.

- **veekun**: Finished up Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon!  Pok√©mon sprites, box sprites, item sprites, and the same data as Sun/Moon.  I say "finished" but of course plenty of stuff is still missing, alas.

- **cc**: I'm trying to make glip some building blocks so that they can actually start building the game, so I made some breakable blocks.  Also wrote a little shader for implementing their parallax background, which involves a bunch of layer modes.

- **misc**: I got a new keyboard.  Also I installed umatrix because noscript's web extension version is half-broken and driving me up the wall.  Sorry, noscript.

Huh, that's not a bad haul, despite a few nights of incredibly bad sleep.  Cool.
