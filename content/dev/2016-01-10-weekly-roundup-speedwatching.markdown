January's theme is **web dev**, and the major project is **spline**, the thing that runs [Floraverse](http://floraverse.com/).

I spent an embarrassingly large chunk of the week watching [AGDQ](https://gamesdonequick.com/) instead of actually doing anything.  Oh well.

- **flora**: I slopped together another _three_ "cutscene" updates, all pretty short but a little time-consuming nonetheless.  I also put some work into refactoring the guts of the player, with modest success.  The eventual goal is to build an editor, so people who aren't me can make little web VNs without having to cobble together a bunch of undocumented JSON and pray it works.

- **art**: Keeping up the [daily comics](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-comic).  They're definitely larger in scope than what I was scrawling in pencil a year ago.  Sort of like speedpaints, but the time limit is loosely defined as "I don't want to spend all day on this".  Trying to vary how I do them, too, though it ultimately comes down to whim.

- **blog**: With some reservations, I wrote [a thing]({filename}/2016-01-04-shut-up-paul-graham-the-simplified-version.markdown) scoffing at how condescending Paul Graham's latest masterpiece was.

- **SLADE**: Bit of very minor work, fixing a few papercuts and trying to diagnose a couple others.

- **Runed Awakening**: Didn't get very far, but I did manage to spend a couple distracted hours stubbing out a puzzle I really like.

And that's it!  Mostly drawing and dabbling.  I (accidentally) woke up early today, so I'm going to try to get a good chunk of something done to get my momentum going again.
