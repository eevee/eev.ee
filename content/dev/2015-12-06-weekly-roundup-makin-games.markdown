Here we go — the first weekly status post, Sunday to Saturday.

This month's theme is **game dev**, and the major project is my text adventure, **Runed Awakening**.

Also I'm going to try picking a major project to focus on each month, along with a general theme that will direct minor projects I work on when I get bored or stuck on the major project.

- **blog**: Wrote a [new post](/blog/2015/11/29/words-mean-things-unfortunately/) about, I guess, boobs.  Added this 'dev log' category, and seeded it with posts about all my Mario Maker levels — big high-quality screenshots and a few paragraphs of what I was thinking.  Started taking notes for blog posts for this month, which I think might end up being a three-part series on getting into Doom mapping.

- **Mario Maker**: Made and released [Pipe Dream](/dev/2015/11/29/mario-maker-pipe-dream/).  Went through and played through all the levels several of my friends have made, leaving doodle comments on all of them.  (The Miiverse drawing interface is super primitive — only one level of undo — so this was surprisingly difficult!)  Made a level called The Works, but I'm not super happy with it and think it has a lot of filler, so I'm sitting on it and will revisit it next time I play.

- **spline**: Did [that stuff for Sketch](/dev/2015/11/30/did-some-spline-work-again/).  Later I went back and improved the YouTube embed support a little, finally fixed thumbnails being shown using full-size images rather than actual thumbnails (oops...), and updated forbiddenflora to take some recent CSS changes into account.

- **art**: Drew [a Psyduck petting a cat](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/672249652398264320) for [@sarahjeong](https://twitter.com/sarahjeong).  Did a lot of doodling, but none of it came out very well; been having this problem a lot lately, ugh.  Also I realize I haven't actually been posting any art on here since it's much more of a pain in the ass than just dragging something to the Twitter web interface, but I'll make an effort to do art roundups every so often.

- **Runed Awakening**: I recently rearranged the entire world and have been dealing with a lot of fallout from that.  The intro sequence saw a lot of improvement, as did some AI.  (I'm being intentionally vague since it's a story/puzzle game and I don't want to spoil it.  This is driving me up the wall.)

Back to doodling!
