Hi!  It's been three weeks again.  But this time it's because I was up to my eyeballs in making a video game, and I generally don't have much to say during those spans beyond "I'm making a video game".

- **alice**: We made a video game!  Or, at least, [a demo]({filename}/updates/2018-03-02-alices-day-off-demo.markdown).  Note: **extremely NSFW** (although that link is fine; it's just a release post).

    I hadn't used Ren'Py a month ago, so there was a lot of scurrying around trying to figure out how to make it do what I want, and then there was a lot of fiction-writing which I have a tough time getting into, but I'm pretty happy with how it came out.  Now we just need to make the other 80% of it.

- **idchoppers**: Oh, yeah, I got the geometry thing I was doing basically working.  Next I gotta adjust the algorithm to work with an arbitrary number of input shapes, which is _slightly_ more complicated.

- **blog**: Wrote about some [tech wishes for 2018]({filename}/2018-02-18-tech-wishes-for-2018.markdown).  Wrote a decent chunk of a post about my experience with idchoppers and Rust and porting weird C++ code, but it had to wait until I'd actually gotten the thing _working_, and then I just didn't finish it yet haha.

Yep, that's it, really busy, bye
