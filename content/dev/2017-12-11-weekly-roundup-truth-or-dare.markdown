Oops, I seem to have missed a week.  I _was_ doing Ludum Dare 40, but then I stopped, because—  well hang on lemme just bullet this.

- **anise!!**: I _intended_ to enter Ludum Dare with glip; we were working on a game about Anise that we'd conceived about a month ago but never gotten around to.  We made pretty decent progress, but realized we couldn't fit anywhere near what we wanted into only three days, so we're just...  running with it.  It's going on a _little_ longer than we wanted, but it's getting pretty fun to play now, and I guess that's pretty good progress given that we had absolutely nothing ten days ago.  I'm even [figuring out AI](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/938681959353425920) for once.

- **fox flux**: Worked on some portraits and big text and [underground tiles](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/934937032912117760).  Made some sound effects.  Did a whole [pretty cool footstep thing](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/936086109435527168) that combines particles with footstep noises and is very great.

- **other games**: I discovered [bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy), the teeniest game engine I've ever seen, and wanted to make something with it — so I made [Roguelike Simulator](https://eevee.itch.io/roguelike-simulator) (and also wrote a [release post]({filename}/updates/2017-12-09-roguelike-simulator.markdown)).

- **cc**: I got so frustrated with trying to find something in Unity Collab history that I cobbled together a thing for exporting Collab history to git.  No, you can't have it, I'm still not convinced it won't delete my entire hard drive or something.  Also I probably fixed a bug in the actual game somewhere in there.

- **blog**: Finally finished that [post about object models]({filename}/2017-11-28-object-models.markdown), only a month late!  Hooray!  Also wrote a [game night]({filename}/2017-12-05-game-night-1-lisa-lisa-moop.markdown) post, which may or may not become a series?

Also some other stuff that I'm not ready to share yet.

I have a lot going on and can't believe the month is a third over yet, but I'm charging forwards!
