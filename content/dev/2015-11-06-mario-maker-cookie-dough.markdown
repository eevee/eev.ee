**Difficulty**: fairly easy  
**Quality**: ★★★★☆  
**Secrets**: 🍄🍄🍄🍄

Vanilla Dome has a cool aesthetic and an unusual style — you navigate up and down through caverns, rather than mostly to the right as is common in Mario.  I tried to capture some of that here.

This was the first time I tried to do any real narrative things with the detailing in the level.  Not some grand coherent plot; just little hints that life is happening here and it's not necessarily centered around you.  I love that in games.

There are also quite a few branching paths, which is a little difficult to cram into Mario Maker where the world can only be two screens tall.  Jamming in a lot of secrets made it even harder, but I managed.  See if you can find them all!  No backtracking required, I think.

There's a boss battle at the end, though the solution is unfortunately not as obvious as I'd hoped.  A surprisingly tricky problem is finding ways to force the player to actually _beat_ the boss, rather than scurry past it.  (I'm not sure anyone has picked up on what the boss _is_, either.)  It's a real shame, because it feels clumsily tacked onto the end of what is otherwise a pretty nice level.

Overall I think this could use a little bit more cohesion, but I'm pretty happy with it.
