July is **themeless**.

- **art**: [Daily Pok√©mon](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-pok%C3%A9mon) remain sporadic.  Some other doodling.

- **blog**: I wrote a thing [about technicalities in communities]({filename}/2016-07-22-on-a-technicality.markdown).  I'm also working on _three_ more posts concurrently, which is great because I still have to publish four more by the end of the week, whoops!

- **book**: I wrote a teeny bit of actual text, then spent much more time fucking around with Sphinx and comparing it to Pandoc and waffling over whether I want to write in rST or TeX.

Mostly writing last week, and mostly writing this week.  I guess July's theme ended up being, um, writing.
