June's theme is **clearing my plate**!  I will finally stop spreading these vegetables around to make it look like I ate some of them, and just sneak them to the dog under the table.

- **art**: I drew a [beautiful manga](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/739639392570986498), which is based on [true events](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/742257852945825792).  I drew a new header image for here, replacing the old poor cutout of a JPEG exported from Pokémon Art Academy, and adjusted the colorscheme of the whole site to match it.  And I did a lot of doodling.  A loooot of doodling.

- **doom**: I did a lot of work on my factory map for DUMP 3, but I don't think I'm going to make the deadline.  I'm okay with that.  I did a mad scramble for DUMP 2 in April, then a longer mad scramble for Under Construction in May; I'm alright with not doing a mad scramble for a third month in a row.  I can still make maps outside of a particular challenge.

- **twitter**: I made [@perlin\_noise](https://twitter.com/perlin_noise), a Twitter bot that tweets Perlin noise in various forms.

- **pyscss**: I'd had a ton of GitHub mail marked unread for ages, so I finally spent a day fixing a lot of easy bugs and [released 1.3.5](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyScss).  I don't plan to spend significant time on this in the future — especially when there's now a libsass in C and [Python bindings to it](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libsass) — but it's nice to see some obvious problems fixed.

- **blog**: It's been [a year since I quit]({filename}/2016-06-12-one-year-later.markdown) now!

It doesn't sound like a lot, but honestly most of the time went into the Doom map and artwork, both of which are things I wanted to do this month.  I'm not sure how I'll schedule the mapping if I'm giving up on DUMP 3; maybe I'll hop on Runed Awakening for a bit and look at the map again later with fresh eyes.
