My sleep got all screwed up _and_ I caught a cold which knocked me on my ass for a couple days.  Very efficient to have both happen simultaneously.  I've made up for it by being a busy beaver so far _this_ week.

As for last week...

- **anise!!**: Good progress!  I fixed screen transitions to not diagonally cut across other chunks of the map (except in an obscure case I noticed two days ago).  Implemented some interactive stuff, drew some extra grass tiles to fill in what glip gave me, polished the first part of the map decently well, and then sat down with glip and sketched out the progression for the rest of the map.

- **blog**: I wrote most of another [Game Night](/blog/tags/#game-night) installment, but managed never to finish it.  I also wrote maybe 60% of an interesting mathy post, which I also managed not to finish yet, largely because I ended up down a rabbit hole for half a day about the intersection of probability and calculus (which is _fascinating_).

And that was about it!  I spent two and a half days just playing through Breath of the Wild while sick; I never actually beat the game.  And now I, er, _still_ haven't beaten it.  I'm trying to find all the shrines before I do, and there are maybe half a dozen left with all the quests finished, so all I can do is run around the world and hope the shrine radar goes off.  I'll get back to that, uh, later.

I guess this'll be the last roundup of 2017!  Happy new year!
