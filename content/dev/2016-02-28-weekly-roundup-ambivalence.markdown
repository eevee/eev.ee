February's theme is **writing**, and the major project is a **book**.

- **Runed Awakening**: Wow!  Fixed a central area!  Laid groundwork for scoring!  Lots of work on, er, a core mechanic!  Lots of work on a major NPC and their related geography!

- **Don't Eat the Cactus**: I went on a brief diversion and created a tiny interactive fiction game called [Don't Eat the Cactus](http://apps.veekun.com/dont-eat-cactus/play.html), which is based on true events.

- **SLADE**: Some more papercuts.  A microscopic amount of work on 3D floor rendering.  (Also, 3.1.1 is out now, so that's pretty cool.  I may update my Doom guides at some point to mention this.)

- **blog**: [I made cheesecake.](/blog/2016/02/28/i-made-cheesecake/)

- **art**: I drew some miscellaneous stuff.  Haven't really been in the mood for daily comics, and my inspiration has run a bit dry; all I do every day is work on stuff or not work on stuff.  I'm working on an art trade and a Pokémon 20th anniversary thing, though.

- **book**: Wow, yes, I did actually write some book, with only a few days left in the month.  I wrote a solid chunk of a chapter, even.  I don't actually like how it came out; it's very dry, with none of the usual casual tone in my blog posts.  I'll have to...  work on that.
