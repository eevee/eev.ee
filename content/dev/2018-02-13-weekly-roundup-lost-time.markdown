I ran out of _brain pills_ near the end of January due to some regulatory kerfuffle, and spent something like a week and a half basically in a daze.  I have incredibly a lot of stuff to do right now, too, so not great timing...  but, well, I guess no time would be especially good.  Oh well.  I got a forced vacation and played some Avernum.

Anyway, in the last _three weeks_, the longest span I've ever gone without writing one of these:

- **anise**: I added a ✨ completely new menu feature ✨ that looks super cool and amazing and will vastly improve the game.  

- **blog**: I wrote [SUPER game night 3]({filename}/2018-01-23-super-game-night-3-games-made-quick-2-0.markdown), featuring a bunch of games from [GAMES MADE QUICK??? 2.0](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick-2)!  It's only a third of them though, oh my god, there were just so many.

    I also backfilled some release posts, including [one for Strawberry Jam 2]({filename}/release/2018-01-24-strawberry-jam-2.markdown) — more on that momentarily.

- **???**: Figured out a little roadmap and started on an ???.

- **idchoppers**: Went down a whole rabbit hole trying to port some academic C++ to Rust, ultimately so I could intersect arbitrary shapes, all so I could try out this ridiculous idea to infer the progression through a Doom map.  This was kind of painful, and is basically the only useful thing I did while unmedicated.  I might write about it.

- **misc**: I threw together a little [PICO-8 prime sieve](https://c.eev.ee/primesieve/) inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UqCyepX3AI).  It's surprisingly satisfying.

    (Hmm, does this deserve a release post?  Where should its permanent home be?  Argh.)

- **art**: I started to draw my Avernum party but only finished [one of them](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/959948923912601600).  I _did_ finish [a comic celebrating the return of my brain pills](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/960994637858054145).

- **neon vn**: I contributed some UI and bugfixing to a visual novel that'll be released on Floraverse tomorrow.

- **alice vn**: For [Strawberry Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/strawberry-jam-2), glip and I are making a ludicrously ambitious horny visual novel in Ren'Py.  Turns out Ren'Py is impressively powerful, and I've been having a blast messing with it.  But also our idea requires me to write about sixty zillion words by the end of the month.  I guess we'll see how that goes.

    I have a (**NSFW**) [progress thread](https://twitter.com/squishfox/status/961614708548628480) going on my smut alt, but honestly, most of the progress for the next week will be "did more writing".

I'm behind again!  Sorry.  I still owe a blog post for last month, and a small project for last month, and now blog posts for _this_ month, and Anise game is kinda in limbo, and I don't know how any of this will happen with this huge jam game taking priority over basically everything else.  I'll see if I can squeeze other stuff in here and there.  I intended to draw more regularly this month, too, but wow I don't think I can even spare an hour a day.

The jam game is forcing me to do a lot of writing that I'd usually dance around and avoid, though, so I think I'll come out the other side of it much better and faster and more confident.

Welp.  Back to writing!
