I bumbled upon a pipe-themed level while playing 100 Mario Challenge, and decided I wanted to do one.  Unfortunately I hit the warp pipe limit much earlier than I'd expected, so it's only _partially_ pipe-themed.  Still, I'm pretty happy with it.

I keep trying to make levels that are easier, more interesting, and less linear, and I think this is the first time I really feel like I hit that mark.  I only spent a few hours on it, too.
