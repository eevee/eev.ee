June's theme is, ah, **clearing my plate**!  Yes, we'll try that again; I have a lot of minor (and not-so-minor) todos that have been hanging over my head for a long time, and I'd like to clear some of them out.  I also want to do [DUMP 3](http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=52276) and make a significant dent in Runed Awakening, so, busy busy.

- **blog**: I published a very fancy explanation of [Perlin noise](/blog/2016/05/29/perlin-noise/), using a lot of diagrams and interactive things I'd spent half the previous week making, but it came out pretty cool!  I also wrote about how I [extracted our game's soundtrack from the PICO-8](/blog/2016/05/30/extracting-music-from-the-pico-8/).  _And_ I edited and published a two-year-old post about [how I switched Yelp from tabs to spaces](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/06/04/converting-a-git-repo-from-tabs-to-spaces/)!  I am _on a roll_ and maybe won't have to write three posts in the same week at the end of the month this time.

    I did a bit of work on the site itself, too.  I linked my Mario Maker levels on the [projects](/projects/) page.  I fixed a PARTYMODE incompatibility with Edge, because I want my DHTML confetti to annoy as many people as possible.  I fixed a silly slowdown with my build process.  And at long last, I fixed the `&nbsp;` cruft in the titles of all my Disqus threads.

- **gamedev**: I wrote a hecka bunch of notes for Mel for a...  thing...  that...  we may or may not end up doing...  but that would be pretty cool if we did.

- **patreon**: I _finally_ got my [Pokémon Showdown](http://pokemonshowdown.com/) adapter working well enough to write a very bad proof of concept battle bot for Sketch, which you can [peruse if you really want to](https://github.com/eevee/dywypi/commit/ff88005bd78e9054ce61de54a8b1d2bb3de70777).  I had some fun asking people to fight the bot, which just chooses moves at complete random and doesn't understand anything about the actual game.  It hasn't won a single time.  Except against me, when I was first writing it, and _also_ choosing moves at complete random.

    I rewrote my Patreon bio, too; now it's a bit more concrete and (ahem) better typeset.

- **doom**: I started on _three_ separate ideas for DUMP 3 maps, though I'm now leaning heavily in favor of just one of them.  (I'd like to continue the other two some other time, though.)  I did a few hours of work each day on it, and while I'm still in the creative quagmire of "what the heck do I do with all this space", it's coming along.  I streamed some of the mapping, which I've never done before, and which the three people still awake at 3am seemed to enjoy.

- **SLADE**: I can't do any Doom mapping without itching to add things to SLADE.  I laid some groundwork for supporting multiple tags per sector, but that got kinda boring, so I rebased my old 3D floors branch and spruced that up a lot.  Fixed a heckton of bugs in it and added support for some more features.  Still a ways off, but [it's definitely getting there](https://github.com/sirjuddington/SLADE/issues/205#issuecomment-223792373).

- **art**: I drew [a June avatar](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/737947325096558593)!  "Drew" might be a strong word, since I clearly modified it from my April/May avatar, but this time I put a lot of effort (and a lot of bugging Mel for advice) into redoing the colors from scratch, and I think it looks [considerably better](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/737950841479397376).

- **spring cleaning**: Sorted through some photos (i.e. tagged which cats were in them), closed a few hundred browser tabs, and the like.

Wow, that's a lot of things!  I'm pretty happy about that; here's to more things!
