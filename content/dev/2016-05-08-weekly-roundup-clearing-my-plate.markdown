May's theme is **clearing my plate**.  I have a lot of small-to-medium-sized stuff I've been intending to do for a while, and the sheer number of things is getting a little overwhelming.  A lengthy todo list starts to get stressful; it feels like constant looming noise in my head.  I want to spend this month getting as much of it as possible out of the way.

- **gamedev**: I have vastly improved [EeveeQuest™](https://c.eev.ee/eeveequest/eeveequest4.html), my dink-around non-game for the [PICO-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).  From where it [started](https://c.eev.ee/eeveequest/eeveequest.html) last Saturday, it's grown momentum, friction, gravity, collision, sound effects, background music (basically my first try at music!), scrolling, a HUD, and some evolution stones.  The PICO-8 is super adorable, by the way.

    Also, Mel decided [we're making a game](http://floraverse.com/comic/oneshots/457-let-s-make-a-game/), so I've been adapting it to fit a map they've been designing.

- **blog**: I rewrote the [list of work I've done](https://eev.ee/projects/) to be less, uh, unreadable garbage.  I also set up subdomains c.ee.vee for hosting hostable work, and t.ee.vee for maybe eventually hosting cat photos and the like.  I think these are pretty clever.

    I also wrote about what it's been like trying to [learn to draw]({filename}/2016-05-06-learning-to-draw-learning-to-learn.markdown).

- **pokémon**: I'm still working on a Pokémon Showdown client for Patreon reasons; I got a bit sidetracked trying to make urwid and asyncio play well together, but I'm well on my way to having a usable API.

- **art**: Lotta doodling.  Appropriately, I think I've gotten a lot better in the last month or so.

- **doom**: I made most of a horrible, horrible pain elemental variant that everyone will hate.

- **irl**: I got Anise microchipped, so _finally_ my cat is a cyborg.  He is better, faster, stronger, and far more mischievous than any pure cat.  His cybernetic enhancements have already enabled him to drive me up the fucking wall far more efficiently today than ever before.

- **Runed Awakening**: In a stroke of inspiration, I figured out a way to connect a puzzle with no reward to a puzzle with no solution.  I'm really happy with the shape the game is taking, even if there's still infinity work left to do.

This week, I would _like_ to finish the PICO-8 game with Mel, write another _two_ posts, finish some of the art I've left hanging, finish this Showdown work, and make at least three significant improvements to Runed Awakening.  Christ, I'd better get started.
