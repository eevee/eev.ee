September is continuing the [three big things in particular]({filename}2016-08-07-weekly-roundup-three-big-things.markdown).

I spoiled most of this last week.

- **gamedev**: I did Ludum Dare 36!  I made a little PICO-8 game called [Isaac's Descent](https://c.eev.ee/isaacs-descent/) in 48 hours.

    Also, I started working on Isaac's Descent HD Remix, a fancier port in LÖVE.  In fact that's pretty much all I did all week, including pixeling a [new walk sequence for Isaac](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/149857888602/work-has-begun-on-isaacs-descent-hd-remix) and porting all the maps to Tiled and some other stuff.  The last couple days in particular went down the collision drain, ugh.  Good book fodder, though.

- **blog**: I published a [timeline of my progress on my Ludum Dare game]({filename}/updates/2016-08-29-i-entered-ludum-dare-36.markdown).

- **book**: Oh, yeah, I'm [writing a book]({filename}/updates/2016-08-29-i-entered-ludum-dare-36.markdown#oh-and-im-writing-a-book).  I wrote a ton of notes for a LÖVE chapter, based on what I did so far for Isaac HD.

- **music**: Fought with a few trackers, with limited success, in an effort to find a grown-up equivalent to the PICO-8's music tools.  Renoise looks interesting and I'll play with it more, but I don't know if I want to plop down any real cash for something I'm only just starting to do.  I might end up just using LMMS.

No big surprises.  I still need to get back to work on veekun, but I'm a bit distracted with LÖVE at the moment, oops.  And of course I have another four posts to write this month, somehow...
