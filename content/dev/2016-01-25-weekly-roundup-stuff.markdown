January's theme is **web dev**, and the major project is **spline**, the thing that runs [Floraverse](http://floraverse.com/).

I'm rapidly discovering that I'm just tired of web dev.

- **art**: [The usual](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/tagged/daily-comic).  Also drew a new avatar, which I will probably be redrawing after some feedback.

- **Mario Maker**: Finished and published [The Works](http://eev.ee/dev/2016/01/17/mario-maker-the-works/).

- **spline**: Made some tiny inroads on getting [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/) to work with reStructuredText instead of HTML, then realized what a mountain of work it was going to be to make anything non-trivial work, and totally gave up.  Settled on storing HTML for now, and got the basic stub of a blog working for Mel.

- **meatspace**: Spent a whole day rearranging furniture — Mel's desk is now in the spare room, and my desk has a lot more breathing room.

- **blog**: Wrote a [birthday post](http://eev.ee/blog/2016/01/22/eevee-gained-2437-experience-points/).

- **tech support**: Helped a friend with some tech stuff and inadvertently discovered the most infamously ornery project owner I have ever seen.

- **Runed Awakening**: Updated to work with the latest Inform 7 release, including hacking around a segfault with some bundled extensions (!).  Drew another experimental item illustration, but this time with pixels.  Not sure what I prefer yet.
