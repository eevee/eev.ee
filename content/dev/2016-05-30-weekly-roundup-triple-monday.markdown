Howdy, stranger.

May's theme is **<s>clearing my pl</s>**â€”  sorry, scratch that, May's theme is _completely out the window_.  I spent two and a half weeks working on virtually nothing but a PICO-8 game with Mel.  Oops.

The upshot is that...  we made [a game, Under Construction](https://c.eev.ee/under-construction/)!  I've never released a serious, complete, independent game before.  Neat.  Here's hoping I do more of that.

A couple of other things happened.

- **art**: I drew a, uh, [Leafeon/Braixen hybrid](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/729477883656216576).  I also drew an Eevee sprite for the credits in Under Construction.

- **doom**: I tinkered a bit when very exhausted with working on UC.  I think I only really made a little progress on the pain elemental variant, and rigged ammo to drop smaller ammo if you didn't need all of it.

- **blog**: I wrote about [making Under Construction]({filename}/updates/2016-05-25-under-construction-our-pico-8-game.markdown) and what it was like to work with the PICO-8.  I also wrote most of an extremely ambitious [Perlin noise]({filename}/2016-05-29-perlin-noise.markdown) post (with interactive gizmos!), which I just finished earlier today.

I still have some obligations left for this month, like one more post (up to four now!  augh!), and then _next_ month I can finally spend clearing my plate.

Except.

Something looms on the horizon.

Is that...

Could it be...

Oh no.
