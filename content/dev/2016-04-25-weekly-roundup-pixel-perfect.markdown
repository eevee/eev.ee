April's theme is **finish Runed Awakening**.

Mel is out of town, so I'm being constantly harassed by cats.

- **irl**: I cleaned the _hell_ out of my room.

- **Runed Awakening**: I finally figured out the concept for a decent chunk of the world, and built about half of it.  I finally, _finally_, feel like the world and plot are starting to come together.  I doubt I'll have it feature-complete in only another week, but I'm miles ahead of where I was at the beginning of the month.  The game is maybe 40% built, but closer to 80% _planned_, and that's been the really hard part.

    I'd previously done two illustrations of items as sort of a proof of concept for embedding images in interactive fiction.  A major blocker was coming up with a palette that could work for _any_ item and keep the overall style cohesive.  I couldn't find an appropriate palette and I'm not confident enough with color to design one myself, so the whole idea was put on hold there.
    
    Last week, a [ludum dare game](https://twitter.com/Managore/status/721912738021134336) led me to the [DB32 palette](http://pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=16247), one of the few palettes I've ever seen that has as many (!) as 32 colors and is intended for general use.  I grabbed [Aseprite](http://www.aseprite.org/) at Twitter's suggestion (which turns out to default to DB32), and I did some pixel art, kind of on a whim!  Twitter pretty well destroyed them, so I posted them in a couple batches on Tumblr: [batch 1](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/143049832207/i-did-some-pixels-maybe-for-runed-awakening), [batch 2](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/143354978277/some-more-pixels), and [a little talking eevee portrait](http://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/143067888162/3-o-3-o-3-o).

    I don't know if the game will end up with an illustration for every object and room — that would be _a lot of pixels_ and these take me a while — but it would be pretty neat to illustrate the major landmarks and most interesting items.

- **spline/flora**: I wrote a quick and dirty [chronological archive for Flora](http://floraverse.com/comic/@@by-date/).  I then did a bunch of witchcraft to replace 250-odd old comic pages with the touched-up versions that appear in [the printed book](https://store.floraverse.com/products/seeds-a-mini-story?taxon_id=48).

- **blog**: I wrote about [elegance]({filename}/2016-04-21-elegance.markdown).  I also started on another post, which is not yet finished.  It's also terrible, sorry.
