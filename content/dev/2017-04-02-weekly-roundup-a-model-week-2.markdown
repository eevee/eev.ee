- **blog**: I'm working on revamping the landing page here, and it's coming along pretty well, but not quite done yet.  Also, worked on some posts.

- **art**: I drew some quick sketchy Isaac's Descent concept art ([twitter](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/846143728448299008), [tumblr](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/158890782042/was-thinkin-about-isaacs-descent)) and also three Eevees in a skirt ([twitter](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/846161037774663680), [tumblr](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/158890799182/ive-finally-come-clean-i-am-in-fact-three-eevees)).

    More noticably, I took another crack at 3D modelling again, to much greater success.  I modelled Lexy ([twitter](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/846906462802591749), [tumblr](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/158978692037/i-made-a-model)), then Kid Neon again ([twitter](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/847607484311150593), [tumblr](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/159024162917/i-modelled-kid-neon-this-is-a-vast-improvement)), then some kinda Eevee ([twitter](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/848415305416060928), [tumblr](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/159101809787/hey-there)).  I didn't intend to let this take over the better part of the week, but it's a whole new thing so it kinda got stuck in my head for a few days.

    Also I became a Veemon for April Fool's Day ([twitter](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/847985196741689344), [tumblr](https://lexyeevee.tumblr.com/post/159126690747/i-became-a-veemon-for-april-fools-day-i-only)).

- **book**: I made a pretty decent dent in writing about collision detection, which is almost as hard as writing collision detection.

- **gamedev**: Little aimless work on fox flux and egg watch.

I've got some writing I _really_ need to finish, but I'm hoping to spend April working on the book and doing low-pressure, vaguely experimental art/game stuff.
