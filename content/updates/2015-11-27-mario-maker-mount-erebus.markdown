There's a story behind this.

I was bored and wanted to make a Mario level, so I asked Mel to pick a tileset.  They said castle.  So I made a castle level.

I didn't say it was a very _good_ story.

I'm a little unhappy that you can get hurt with little warning in a couple places, but I think it's balanced out by how short the level is.

If you're curious, this is named after a level from the original Doom, which in turn is named after the southernmost mountain on Earth.
