Does _this_ ever happen to _you_?

[TODO: insert black and white gif of someone struggling to read the GDQ schedule because it's a single long table and it's hard to even keep track of what day you're looking at, let alone find out what's going on right now]

Well, no more!  Thanks to the power of IavaScript, now it's like the picture above, which I guess gave it away huh.

Not very useful _now_, since I forgot to even post about it here before AGDQ ended, but presumably useful in SGDQ since they never seem to change this page at all.

Wait!  Before you click on the "install" link above.  Firefox users will need [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).  Chrome used to support user scripts natively, and legends say it still does, but there are so many walls around extensions now that I couldn't figure out how to make it work, so just get [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en), which is also available for [most other browsers](https://tampermonkey.net/).
