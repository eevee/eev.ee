**Difficulty**: slightly tricky, not in a good way  
**Quality**: ★★★☆☆  
**Secrets**: 🍄🍄 + "secret exit"

Boo houses are cool.  Mario Maker adds a Boo house theme for the classic Mario tileset.  Awesome.

I tried to make this moderately confusing and weird, as Boo houses ought to be.  I think I may have overshadowed that a little bit with some annoying jumps into Boo circles, though.  And unfortunately this predates checkpoints, though it direly needs one.

Still, I enjoy playing it just for the strange environment, so maybe you will too.
