**Difficulty**: very easy  
**Quality**: ★★★★☆  
**Secrets**:

I was rolling a [Doom random level theme generator](http://www.jmickle.com/genrerator/maptheme.html) for speedmapping purposes, and one of the prompts it gave was "The Wreckage".  I didn't really know how to make that in Doom in only an hour, but I _did_ know how to make it in Mario, so I did.

The additional rules were "no monsters" and "no stairs", so neither of those things appear in this level.  It's quick and entirely atmospheric.  I like it.  Though it'd be slightly better if I'd correctly named it "The Wreckage".  Oh well.
