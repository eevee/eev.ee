üîó [**Strawberry Jam 2 on itch**](https://itch.io/jam/strawberry-jam-2)  

I'm running a game jam, and _this_ announcement is _before_ the jam starts!  What a concept!

The idea is simple: you have all of February to make a _horny game_.

(This jam is, as you may have guessed, **NSFW**.  üîû)

I think there's a lot of interesting potential at the intersection of sex and games, but we see very little exploration of it ‚Äî in large part because mega-platforms like Steam (and its predecessor, Walmart) have historically been really squeamish about anything sexual.  Unless it's scantily-clad women draped over everything, that's fine.  But _un_-clad women are right out.  Also gratuitous high-definition gore is cool.  But no nipples!!

The result is a paltry cultural volume of games _about sex_, but as boundaries continue to be pushed without really being broken, we get more and more blockbuster games with sex _awkwardly tacked on top_ as lazy titillation.  "Ah, it's a story-driven role-playing shooter, but in this one part you can have sex, which will affect nothing and never come up again, but you can see a _butt_!"  Truly revolutionary.

The opposite end of the spectrum also exists, in the form of porn games where the _game_ part is tacked on to make something interactive ‚Äî you know, click really fast to make clothes fall off or whatever.  It's not _especially_ engaging, but it's more compelling than staring at a JPEG.

So my secret motive here is to encourage people to explore the vast gulf in the middle ‚Äî to make games that are interesting as games _and_ that feature sexuality as a _fundamental part of the game_.  Something where both parts could stand alone, yet are so intertwined as to be inseparable.

The one genre that _is_ seeing a lot of experimentation is the raunchy visual novel, which is a great example: they tend to tell stories where sexuality plays a heavy part, but they're still compelling interactive stories and hold up on those grounds just as well.  What, I wonder, would this same sort of harmony look like for other genres, other kinds of interaction?  What does a horny racing game look like, or a horny inventory-horror game, or a horny brawler?  Hell, why are there no horny co-op games to speak of?  That seems obvious, right?

I haven't said all this on the jam page because it would add half a dozen paragraphs to what is already a lengthy document.  I also suspect that I'll sound like I'm suggesting "a racing game but all the cars are dicks," which isn't _quite_ right, and I'd need to blather even more to clarify.  Anyway, it seems vaguely improper as the jam organizer to be telling people what kind of games _not_ to make; last year I just tried to lead by example by making [fox flux](https://eevee.itch.io/fox-flux).

If exploring this design space seems interesting to you, please do join in!  If you've never made a game before, this might be a great opportunity to give it a try ‚Äî everything is going to be embarrassing and personal regardless.  Maybe hop on [Discord](http://discord.gg/uussQdz) if you need help or want a teammate.  Feel free to flip through [last year's entries](https://itch.io/jam/strawberry-jam/entries), too, or my (**super nsfw**) [thread where I played some and talked about them](https://twitter.com/squishfox/status/838196998826139649).  _Some_ of them are even open source, cough, cough.
