title: Fair warning: minor restructuring ahead

I started using Tumblr some time ago to publish sporadic shorter writing, as a way to combat the feeling that everything I wrote in this "real blog" had to be long and semi-formal.  The short writing more or less migrated to Twitter, but Tumblr remained for some community-specific griping.  When I started learning to draw, it was an obvious place to stick my doodles as well.

But Tumblr is a frustrating platform that I've never found myself particularly enjoying.  Plus, it seems a shame to have this _amazing_ domain hack and only use it for one kind of thing.

So I'm going to try expanding the purview of my tiny platform.  Pelican isn't quite designed for this, but I'm going to turn its concept of "categories" into more like content types, whatever that ends up meaning.  "Blog" is now its own category; I've put all my old posts in it and will put other long-form writing in it in the future.  (I also cleaned up the tags I use, merged the old categories into tags, and hid single-use tags from the sidebar.)

I haven't decided exactly what else will go here yet.  Posting art is an obvious start, and I might even backfill all my doodles since I started drawing in January.  I might write some shorter and more "disposable" things.  I might write short updates on particular projects.  I might post tons of cat photos, and backfill those too.  I might try keeping a "dev journal", where every single day I write a quick paragraph or two about what I did.

I mention this mainly as a heads up to any techies who're following via the feed.  If you want to see anything and everything I publish, it'll all be in the same [global Atom feed](/feeds/atom.xml), so you don't need to do anything.  If you **only** want to follow my blog, there should be [a new feed just for blog posts](/feeds/blog.atom.xml).  Every category gets its own feed, so you can also mix and match as you please, once I get some other categories started.

Are you excited?  I'm excited.
