title: The NSA is trying to create a virtual clone of me

[@softfennec](https://twitter.com/softfennec) and [@orezpraw](https://twitter.com/orezpraw) brought to my attention the following tweet, which I have to reconstruct from memory for reasons that will be clear in a moment:

> I like to think I'm okay at math, but then I stumble into Math SE and it's Latin to me. [http://math.stackexchange.com/q/1665383/58532](http://math.stackexchange.com/q/1665383/58532)

What a hilarious joke!  I liked it so much that it turns out I'd already made it myself:

> i like to think i'm ok at math but then i stumble into math.SE and it is basically lorem ipsum to me [http://math.stackexchange.com/q/1665383/58532](http://math.stackexchange.com/q/1665383/58532)

It seems there's a Twitter account that has been copying my tweets, along with the tweets of half a dozen other tech people who follow me.  I don't mean stealing our jokes; I mean _only_ tweeting paraphrases of our tweets, even fairly mundane ones.  It's a shame that I can't show you the account in full, because after an hour of our trying to figure out what was going on, I finally made a public tweet about this — and the account instantly vanished.  (The [profile pic](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/561954159323119616/cBSAWibH_400x400.jpeg) still exists, so it's possible the account just renamed and then locked itself to hide from search.)

There _is_ a [recent copy](https://archive.is/bxnPe) on archive.is, from Feb 28, where you can see a rewording of [a tweet I made about getting cheesecake ingredients](https://twitter.com/eevee/status/702656586519425024) about a page down.  archive.org has two snapshots, both from 2013, but [this one](https://web.archive.org/web/20131217160207/https://twitter.com/tilapya_) is fairly telling — it reads as perfectly normal, _but the bio is mine!_

So please believe me when I stress, very very strongly, just how bizarre this is.  I'm plenty familiar with bot accounts on Twitter that try to look normal so they can be sold as fake followers.  I hate them with such a burning passion that I obsessively check on everyone who follows me so I can block/report any junk.  I've seen quite a few of them by now.

And they are always, _always_ obvious to a human being.  At worst, they're slightly _less_ obvious.  There's no reason for them to try to look real to a person, anyway, because they only need to be good enough to fool automated spam tools.  Twitter can't reasonably hand-check all of its millions of accounts.

They'll tweet obvious spam links.  They'll copy a tweet that was the middle of a thought and makes no sense on its own.  They'll Markov a little too heavily, and cut a sentence off halfway.  They'll screw up copying some non-ASCII.  They'll contradict themselves by copying text from two very different people.  Sometimes they're less obvious, but they're always obvious.

Whatever this was, it was completely different.  Because it pulled from a small circle of people, it tweeted about the same general topics.  It made repeated references to being female, to wearing contacts, to having a strong interest in milk — without ever contradicting itself.  It made followup tweets that continued a thought.  It never tweeted junk links.  It kept a consistent writing style.  It occasionally retweeted jokes that I could believe the persona found funny.

It looked like the account of an average nerd named "Nikki V."  Except that it had 1600 followers, yet never garnered a single like or retweet.  And seemingly everything it wrote was a paraphrase of someone else.

The kicker here is that it was so good, _I cannot believe it was automatic_.  You might think the above tweet was generated by some rules that fix capitalization and a little [text spinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_spinning), right?  Well, I already contest that a bot is unlikely to realize "math.SE" can be reasonably written as "Math SE" instead of interpreting it as a link.  But also, consider this pair:

What kind of word list would even think to include "sphynx" and "puppy" as potentially interchangeable?  How would software know that a question mark can go on the end of that non-question?

(This blog software turns everything into curly quotes automatically, but it's worth noting that my original tweet had a plain quote, whereas this account _always_ uses curly quotes.)

Or how about these, which were both accompanied by the same screenshot of some obtuse legalese:

I don't know who @avdangeles is, but their Twitter bio indicates they're a tax lawyer.  And also one of the only two [archive.org snapshots of this account](https://web.archive.org/web/20130617165127/https://twitter.com/tilapya_) shows them tweeting at that same person in 2013!

The joke — the _sarcastic_ joke — was completely rewritten with a nod to a sensibly-chosen third party who the account appears to know.

Or take these:

How could an automated system possibly add the reasonable context of "Federal websites", which are known for this sort of clumsy tech oversight?  I was even talking about doing income taxes at the time, so that's not unreasonable to infer, though I was actually talking about several bank websites.

These are the only tweets I still had open in tabs when the account was deleted, but you get the idea.  I also saw several of my tweets get copied, unmodified, except that they also had an appropriate smiley added.  And these are just my own tweets that I recognized; I hadn't gotten around to comparing the others' tweets yet.

The account was _six years old_ and looked to have copied from other sources before.  I saw one case where it copied someone else's reply to a Demetri Marin tweet, but exapnded upon it:

> @DemetriMartin is there an "and" missing? third line?

This is extraordinarily bizarre and I am at a loss to explain it.  I can only think of two ways this could've happened:

1. An actual human being, who has enough general tech knowledge to ensure nerdy tweets still make sense, is spending an awful lot of time manually copying tweets from a small circle of tech friends.  And has been doing so for years.  And doesn't seem to be gaining anything from it.

    Granted, this _could_ just be a fake follower account, but why would someone put so much apparent _manual_ effort into it?  Those fake follower places sell _a thousand_ junk followers for ten bucks; it can't possibly be worth trying so hard just to make one of them vaguely resemble an actual person.

2. Alternatively, the NSA has a secret program to build an AI to simulate the perfect nerd, and it's already so good that it independently thinks of the same tweets I do, right around the same time.  Soon it will replace me, and no one will know the difference.

That's all I've got.  Any other ideas?
