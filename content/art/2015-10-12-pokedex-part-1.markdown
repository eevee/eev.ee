"Inktober" is a thing where you do an ink drawing every day throughout October.  I tried it, mostly got frustrated at producing scribbly crap with errant lines everywhere, and gave up after a few days.

I know drawing without relying on an eraser is good practice, and it's definitely something I want to get better at.  So here's an attempt at combining it with speedpainting, where poor results are more palatable, because hey I didn't have much time anyway.

The rules:

* Draw Pokémon, in order
* Pose must be different from the stock/reference artwork
* I _have_ to publish the results, no matter how terrible
* 5 minute hard time limit
* No erasing
* No undo
* No layers
* No layer modes
* No starting over
* No cheating

Mel pointed out that the rules are likely to get old after a while, so I might shake them up every couple dozen or so, or change how I'm drawing, or whatever.

Here's the first batch.  I'm _underwhelmed_, but not ready to throw my tablet out the window, so that's an improvement.  Let's see how this goes.
