Eevee grew to level 33!

<!-- more -->

I had kind of a rough year.  Between medication issues, a lot of interpersonal tangles, and discovering ancient trauma, it feels like my head is full of static a lot of the time, and I don't know how to create when I'm in that state.  I might be able to _function_, even do rote programming work, but I just can't _synthesize_.

And that sucks.  I miss it.  I miss writing!  I barely wrote anything here all year.  I've had a half-finished post open for months and just haven't been able to wrap it up and get it out.

I'm working on it.  It's just hard.

Ash and I made [Cherry Kisses](https://eevee.itch.io/cherry-kisses) (**nsfw**), probably the best puzzle game I've designed and the most polished game we've released, so that was nice.  I also made a [particle wipe generator]({filename}/updates/2019-04-20-particle-wipe-generator.markdown) out of the screen wipe effect I used in the game.

I started on baz, a game creator meant to kinda blend the styles of MegaZeux and PuzzleScript and bitsy, but it's yet to see the light of day.

I worked a lot on fox flux â€” adding water physics, redesigning the player sprite, inventing some new mechanics, adding a menu, refactoring to use an ECS-like approach, massively cleaning up my collision code, and whatnot.  I also got stuck in a quagmire of trying to make push physics work how I want, but never actually got it working despite pouring weeks and weeks into it, and now the whole codebase is in a broken shambles.  Kind of a mixed bag there.

I finally started on GLEAM, an editor for the VN engine I've used for Floraverse for many years now.  It's not _quite_ ready for public use, but it's far enough along that I can make VNs with it and only a little manual adjusting, which is cool.

[Twigs died.]({filename}/2019-10-26-goodbye-twigs.markdown)

After half a year of pulling teeth, we managed to get Ash's divorce from Marl finalized.

Ash and I married.

I did the [advent calendar]({filename}/updates/2020-01-02-advent-calendar-2019.markdown), which included a dozen or so smaller projects.  That was pretty fun, if a bit ambitious.

I drew more than the previous year, I think, and probably got better at it.  I even drew some character references, at long last.

I don't know what I'll do this year!  I'm tired of listing a bunch of ambitions and then not being able to do them.  But I'll keep trying.
