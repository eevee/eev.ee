Oh, I think I have some stuff to say about community management, in light of recent events.  None of it hasn't already been said elsewhere, but I have to get this out.

Hopefully the content warning is implicit in the title.

I am frustrated.

I've gone on before about a [particularly bothersome phenomenon]({filename}/2016-07-22-on-a-technicality.markdown) that hurts a lot of small online communities: often, people are willing to tolerate the misery of others in a community, but then get up in arms when someone pushes back.  Someone makes a lot of off-hand, off-color comments about women?  Uses a lot of dog-whistle terms?  Eh, they're not bothering anyone, or at least not bothering me.  Someone else gets tired of it and tells them to knock it off?  _Whoa there!_  Now we have the _appearance_ of conflict, which is unacceptable, and people will turn on the person who's pissed off — even though they've been at the butt end of an _invisible_ conflict for who knows how long.  The _appearance_ of peace is paramount, even if it means a large chunk of the population is quietly miserable.

Okay, so now, imagine that on a vastly larger scale, and also those annoying people who know how to skirt the rules are Nazis.

The label "Nazi" gets thrown around a lot lately, probably far too easily.  But when I see a group of people doing the Hitler salute, waving large Nazi flags, wearing Nazi armbands styled after the SS, well...  if the shoe fits, right?  I suppose they might have flown across the country to join a torch-bearing mob _ironically_, but if so, the joke is going way over my head.  (Was the murder ironic, too?)  Maybe they're not Nazis in the sense that the original party doesn't exist any more, but for ease of writing, let's refer to "someone who espouses Nazi ideology and deliberately bears a number of Nazi symbols" as, well, "a Nazi".

This isn't a new thing, either; I've stumbled upon any number of Twitter accounts that are decorated in Nazi regalia.  I suppose the trouble arises when perfectly innocent members of the alt-right get unfairly labelled as Nazis.

But hang on; this march was called "Unite the Right" and was intended to bring together various far right sub-groups.  So what does their choice of aesthetic say about those sub-groups?  I haven't heard, say, alt-right coiner Richard Spencer denounce the use of Nazi symbology — extra notable since _he was fucking there_ and apparently didn't care to discourage it.

----

And so begins the rule-skirting.  "Nazi" is definitely overused, but even using it to describe white supremacists who make not-so-subtle nods to Hitler is likely to earn you some sarcastic derailment.  A Nazi?  Oh, so is _everyone_ you don't like and who wants to establish a white ethno state a Nazi?

Calling someone a Nazi — or even a white supremacist — is an _attack_, you see.  Merely expressing the desire that people of color not exist is perfectly peaceful, but identifying the sentiment for what it is causes visible discord, which is unacceptable.

These clowns even know this sort of thing and [strategize around it](https://twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/896823834338263041).  Or, try, at least.  Maybe it wasn't that successful this weekend — though flicking through Charlottesville headlines now, they seem to be relatively tame in how they refer to the ralliers.

I'm reminded of a group of furries — the _alt-furries_ — who have been espousing white supremacy and wearing red armbands with a white circle containing a black...  _pawprint_.  Ah, yes, that's completely different.

----

So, what to do about this?

"[Ignore them](https://twitter.com/splcenter/status/896370696158400512)" is a popular option, often espoused to bullied children by parents who have never been bullied, shortly before they resume complaining about passive-aggressive office politics.  The trouble with ignoring them is that, just like in smaller communitiest, they have a tendency to _fester_.  They take over large chunks of influential Internet surface area like 4chan and Reddit; they help get an inept buffoon elected; and then they start to have torch-bearing rallies and run people over with cars.

4chan illustrates a kind of corollary here.  Anyone who's steeped in Internet Culture™ is surely familiar with 4chan; I was never a regular visitor, but it had enough influence that I was still _aware_ of it and some of its culture.  It was always thick with irony, which grew into a sort of ironic detachment — perhaps one of the major sources of the recurring online trope that having feelings is bad — which proceeded into ironic racism.

And now the ironic racism is indistinguishable from actual racism, as tends to be the case.  Do they "actually" "mean it", or are they just trying to get a rise out of people?  What the hell is _unironic_ racism if not trying to get a rise out of people?  What difference is there to onlookers, especially as they move to become increasingly involved with politics?

"It's just a joke" and "it was just a thoughtless comment" are exceptionally common defenses made by people desperate to preserve the illusion of harmony, but the strain of overt white supremacy currently running rampant through the US was _built on those excuses_.

----

The other favored option is to _debate them_, to defeat their ideas with better ideas.

Well, hang on.  What are their ideas, again?  I hear they were chanting stuff like "go back to Africa" and "fuck you, faggots".  Given that this was an overtly political rally (and again, the _Nazi fucking regalia_), I don't think it's a far cry to describe their ideas as "let's get rid of black people and queer folks".

This is an underlying proposition: that white supremacy is inherently violent.  After all, if the alt-right seized total political power, what would they do with it?  If I asked the same question of Democrats or Republicans, I'd imagine answers like "universal health care" or "screw over poor people".  But people whose primary goal is to have a country full of only white folks?  What are they going to do, _politely ask_ everyone else to leave?  They're invoking the memory of people who _committed genocide_ and also _tried to take over the fucking world_.  They are _outright saying_, these are the people we look up to, this is who we think had a great idea.

How, precisely, does one defeat these ideas with rational debate?

Because the underlying core philosophy beneath all this is: "it would be good for me if everything were about me".  And **that's true**!  (Well, it probably wouldn't work out how they imagine in practice, but it's true _enough_.)  Consider that slavery is probably fantastic _if you're the one with the slaves_; the issue is that it's _reprehensible_, not that the very notion contains some kind of 101-level logical fallacy.  That's probably why we _had a fucking war over it_ instead of hashing it out over brunch.

...except we _did_ hash it out over brunch once, and the result was that slavery was still allowed but slaves only counted as 60% of a person for the sake of counting how much political power states got.  So that's how rational debate worked out.  I'm sure the slaves were thrilled with that progress.

That really only leaves _pushing back_, which raises the question of how to push back.

And, I don't know.  Pushing back is much harder in spaces you don't control, spaces you're already struggling to justify your own presence in.  For most people, that's most spaces.  It's made all the harder by that tendency to preserve illusory peace; even the tamest request that someone knock off some odious behavior can be met by pushback, even by third parties.

At the same time, I'm aware that white supremacists prey on disillusioned young white dudes who feel like they don't fit in, who were promised the world and inherited kind of a mess.  Does criticism drive them further away?  The alt-right also opposes "political correctness", i.e. "not being a fucking asshole".

God knows we all suck at this kind of behavior correction, even within our own in-groups.  Fandoms have become almost ridiculously vicious as platforms like Twitter and Tumblr [amplify individual anger to deafening levels]({filename}/2016-02-15-everyones-offended-these-days.markdown).  It probably doesn't help that we're all just _exhausted_, that every new fuck-up feels like it bears the same weight as the last hundred combined.

This is the part where I admit I don't know anything about people and don't have any easy answers.  Surprise!

The other alternative is, well, _punching Nazis_.

That meme kind of haunts me.  It raises really fucking complicated questions about when violence is acceptable, in a culture that's completely incapable of answering them.

America's relationship to violence is so bizarre and two-faced as to be almost incomprehensible.  We _worship_ it.  We have the biggest military in the world by an almost comical margin.  It's fairly mainstream to own deadly weapons for the express stated purpose of armed revolution against the government, should that become necessary, where "necessary" is left ominously undefined.  Our movies are about explosions and beating up bad guys; our video games are about explosions and shooting bad guys.  We fantasize about solving foreign policy problems by nuking someone — hell, our talking heads are currently in polite discussion about whether we should nuke North Korea and annihilate up to twenty-five million people, as punishment for daring to have the bomb that only _we're_ allowed to have.

But...  violence is bad.

That's about as far as the other side of the coin gets.  It's bad.  We condemn it in the strongest possible terms.  Also, guess who we bombed today?

I observe that the one time Nazis _were_ a serious threat, America was happy to let them try to take over the world until their allies finally showed up on our back porch.

Maybe I don't understand what "violence" means.  In a quest to find out why people are talking about "leftist violence" lately, I found a [National Review article from May](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/447253/violence-left-campus-streets) that twice suggests blocking traffic is a form of violence.  Anarchists have smashed some windows and set a couple fires at protests this year — and, hey, please knock that crap off? — which is called violence against, I guess, Starbucks.  Black Lives Matter could be throwing a birthday party and Twitter would still be abuzz with people calling them thugs.

Meanwhile, there's a trend of murderers with increasingly overt links to the alt-right, and everyone is still handling them with kid gloves.  First it was murders by people repeating their talking points; now it's the culmination of a torches-and-pitchforks mob.  (Ah, sorry, not pitchforks; _assault rifles_.)  And we still get this incredibly bizarre both-sides-ism, a White House that refers to the people who _didn't_ murder anyone as "[just as violent if not more so](https://twitter.com/gabrielsherman/status/896714418490355714)".

Should you punch Nazis?  I don't know.  All I know is that I'm extremely dissatisfied with discourse that's extremely alarmed by hypothetical punches — far more mundane than what you'd see after a sporting event — but treats a push for ethnic cleansing as a mere difference of opinion.

The equivalent to a punch in an online space is probably banning, which is almost laughable in comparison.  It doesn't cause physical harm, but it _is_ a use of concrete force.  Doesn't pose quite the same moral quandary, though.

Somewhere in the middle is the currently popular pastime of doxxing (doxxxxxxing) people spotted at the rally in an attempt to get them fired or whatever.  Frankly, that skeeves me out, though apparently not enough that I'm directly chastizing anyone for it.

----

We aren't really equipped, as a society, to deal with memetic threats.  We aren't even equipped to determine what they _are_.  We had a fucking _world war_ over this, and now people are outright saying "hey I'm like those people we went and killed a lot in that world war" and we give them interviews and compliment their fashion sense.

A looming question is always, _what if they then do it to you?_  What if people try to get _you_ fired, to punch _you_ for your beliefs?

I think about that a lot, and then I remember that it's perfectly legal to fire someone for being gay in half the country.  (Courts are currently wrangling whether Title VII forbids this, but with the current administration, I'm not optimistic.)  I know people who've been fired for coming out as trans.  I doubt I'd have to look very far to find someone who's been punched for either reason.

And these aren't even beliefs; they're just properties of a person.  You can _stop_ being a white supremacist, one of those people yelling "fuck you, faggots".

So I have to recuse myself from this asinine question, because I can't fairly judge the risk of retaliation when it already happens to people I care about.

Meanwhile, if a white supremacist _does_ get punched, I absolutely still want my tax dollars to pay for their universal healthcare.

The same wrinkle comes up with free speech, which is _paramount_.

The ACLU [reminds us](https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/896508486976131073) that the First Amendment "protects vile, hateful, and ignorant speech".  I think they've forgotten that that's a _side effect_, not the _goal_.  No one sat down and suggested that protecting vile speech was some kind of noble cause, yet that's how we seem to be treating it.

The _point_ was to avoid a situation where _the government_ is arbitrarily deciding what qualifies as vile, hateful, and ignorant, and was using that power to eliminate ideas distasteful to politicians.  You know, like, hypothetically, if they interrogated and jailed a bunch of people for supporting the wrong economic system.  Or convicted someone under the Espionage Act for [opposing the draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States).  (Hey, that's where the "shouting fire in a crowded theater" line comes from.)

But these are ideas that are already _in the government_.  Bannon, a man who was chair of a news organization he himself called "the platform for the alt-right", has the President's ear!  How much more mainstream can you get?

So again I'm having a little trouble balancing "we need to defend the free speech of white supremacists or risk losing it for everyone" against "we fairly recently were ferreting out communists and the lingering public perception is that communists are scary, not that the government is".

----

This isn't to say that freedom of speech is bad, only that the way we talk about it has become _fanatical_ to the point of absurdity.  We love it so much that we turn around and try to apply it to corporations, to platforms, to communities, to interpersonal relationships.

Look at 4chan.  It's completely public and anonymous; you only get banned for putting the functioning of the site itself in jeopardy.  _Nothing_ is stopping a larger group of people from joining its politics board and tilting sentiment the other way — except that the current population is so odious that no one wants to be around them.  Everyone else has evaporated away, as tends to happen.

Free speech is great for a _government_, to prevent quashing politics that threaten the status quo (except it's a joke and they'll do it anyway).  People can't very readily just bail when the government doesn't like them, anyway.  It's also nice to keep in mind to some degree for ubiquitous _platforms_.  But the smaller you go, the easier it is for people to evaporate away, and the faster pure free speech will turn the place to crap.  You'll be left only with people who care about nothing.

----

At the very least, it seems clear that the goal of white supremacists is some form of _destabilization_, of disruption to the fabric of a community for purely selfish purposes.  And _those_ are the kinds of people you want to get rid of as quickly as possible.

Usually this is hard, because they act just nicely enough to create some plausible deniability.  But damn, if someone is outright _telling_ you they love Hitler, maybe skip the principled hand-wringing and eject them.
