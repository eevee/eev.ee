Look at this sweet guy [Mel][] got [custom-made][Caldera on dA] for my birthday.  There's context here, but it's [big and complicated][PMDe], so let's just say it's a life-size stained-glass [Chandelure][] and is _totally fuckin rad_.  (That's an official life-size Eevee, for scale.)

Having a bit of trouble finding a place to keep a three-foot-tall plush, though.  He's got a hook near the top of his flame, but hanging him from the ceiling doesn't really help since he hangs down to chest level.

While I'm at it, my collection expanded considerably after our two-week vacation in Japan, and I finally got around to adding a new shelf to hold them all.  So, here's what my room looks like now...

{% photo /media/2013-01/pokemons-shelf-left.jpg Left side of a big ol' shelf we stuck over my desk. %}
{% photo /media/2013-01/pokemons-shelf-right.jpg Right side of the big ol' shelf over my desk.  There are a few guys in the background you can't see very well from below. %}
{% photo /media/2013-01/pokemons-closet.jpg All legendaries.  This is technically a closet, but it has no doors or track, so my desk sits partly inside it. %}
{% photo /media/2013-01/pokemons-desk-clock.jpg In case the Celebi doesn't make me enough of a nerd, this clock can also show hex, binary, octal, and Roman numerals. %}
{% photo /media/2013-01/pokemons-desk-ell.jpg The two biggest Eevees are different life-size releases.  Far right Eevee talks!  And something here is out of place... %}
{% photo /media/2013-01/pokemons-desk.jpg This is where the magic happens.  If by magic you mean sufficiently-advanced technology. %}

I'm not too proud to admit that I might have a problem: where can I possibly fit more shelves?
