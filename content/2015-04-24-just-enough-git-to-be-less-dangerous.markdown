Do you just _hate_ [Git][]?  Are you perfectly happy with Mercurial (or, yikes, Subversion) but once a month you have to brave Git because everyone and their damn dog is now using GitHub?  Are you vaguely aware that about half of all Git commands will probably delete all your work forever, but you don't know which ones and you don't want to spend three weeks poring over the documentation?

Good news!  I wrote you this amazing Internet post.  I hope I can mash just enough Git into your face that you will be less likely to set things on fire, and also less terrified that you might set things on fire.  This should also be enough to make the [Git documentation][git doc index] a little more comprehensible; it's extremely thorough, but also overwhelming and nonsensical if you haven't already read half of it.

I'm trying to keep this brief but also potentially useful to people who have never touched version control _at all_, so there are some 101 bits sprinkled throughout.  Fear not!  I don't actually think Mercurial users have no idea what a patch is.

## What is even going on here

First it's helpful to understand Git's design, or at least what its creator was thinking about when it was built.

Git is a DVCS, or "distributed version control system", where "version control system" means "remembers the history of your files", and "distributed" means "you can do it without being online".  (Back in the day, committing involved immediately uploading your changes to a central server.  You _could not commit code_ if you couldn't connect to the server.  I know, right?)

Git was invented by Linus Torvalds, the angry man who also brought us the Linux kernel.  Linux is a _huge_ project with a _very long_ history, and it was outgrowing the VCS it was using, so Linus decided to write a new one, because he's a programmer and we do that.

The Linux development process is what you might expect a bunch of people who work on the Linux kernel to come up with: they email patches around.  (A patch is just a text file that lists some changes between two versions of some files.  You can apply the patch to the old version to get the new version.)

So Linus has the "canonical" copy of the codebase, which you might call a "repository", because that's a place for storing things.  Every so often you might download a fresh copy, and you'll go write some broken wifi drivers or whatever, and now you have something different than what you started with.  So you generate a patch against the original code, and you email it to the mailing list, and someone says "looks good to me", and Linus applies that patch to his copy of the codebase.  Now everyone else who goes to check out the code will see your work in there too.

The great secret to understanding Git, that I hope will make your eyes go wide and an "ahh" noise come out of your mouth, is this:

**Git is just a bunch of tools for emailing patches around.**

No, seriously.  There are like five commands in the core Git distribution for this _express purpose_.  There's even a [subheading in the docs][git doc index]: `am`, `apply`, `format-patch`, `send-email`, `request-pull`.  You can go look at the [Linux kernel mailing list][lkml] right now and see that this is _still_ how they do things, just with Git doing most of the boring work.  Even the [Git manpage][] just describes Git as "the stupid content tracker".

Git is a collection of one-off tools for solving a particular problem, which is probably not the problem _you_ are trying to solve.

Let us examine the Git model with this in mind.

### Commits

A commit is a patch.  That's it.  It lists some changes to some files, in "unified diff" format.

It also has some headers, which look _suspiciously a whole lot kind of like email headers_.  There's an author, and a timestamp, and some other stuff.

Here's where the magic happens.  Remember, a patch expresses _differences_ between two sets of files.  (Let's call them "trees" — as in directory trees.)  So if you email me a patch, I can't do a lot with it unless we agree on what I'm applying the patch _to_.  It might be helpful to specify, say, "apply this to the Linux kernel".  It might be even more helpful to specify "apply this to Linux kernel release 3.0.5".

A Git commit encodes this by having a "parent" header, saying which commit this one should be applied on top of.

Ah, but wait, a commit is just a patch.  How do you apply a patch to another patch?  You can only apply a patch to a full set of files (tree).  But after you do, you get a _new_ full set of files (tree).  So "commit" is also used to mean "the state of the repository after applying this patch".

That still leaves you with a bit of a recursive problem.  If you have commit **C**, and it says its parent is **B**...  well, you don't know what the state of the repository at **B** looks like until you apply _that_, so you need to look at _its_ parent, right?

Right.  Git history is really a long chain of instructions for how to recreate a codebase from scratch, one step at a time.  Imagine it as a _pile_ of patches, like an inbox on your desk.  Some trivial history might look like this:

* **Commit C**: My parent is **B**.  Add "three" to the end of the file "numbers.txt".
* **Commit B**: My parent is **A**.  Add "two" to the end of the file "numbers.txt".
* **Commit A**: Create the file "numbers.txt" containing "one".

Here, commit **A** is a little bit special, in that it has no parent.  That means that its patch can only create new files — there are no existing files to change!  Otherwise it's just a commit like any other.

So you start out with nothing.  Then you apply patch **A**, which gives you `one`.  Then you can apply patch **B**, which gives you `one two`.  And finally you can apply patch **C**, which gives you `one two three`, the state of the codebase as of commit **C**.  (Git doesn't literally do this every time, of course; there is plenty of smart caching and whatnot.  But the model acts pretty much like this.)

Git's documentation tends to draw history from left to right, so the above would be displayed as:

    :::text
    A---B---C

Same idea, just written differently.  It makes a little more sense if you imagine arrows: **A** → **B** → **C**.

In reality, commits are identified not by letters but by hashes, which look like `8edc525cd8dc9e81b5fbeb297c44dd513ba5518e` but are generally shortened to `8edc52`.  You might think they're called "hashes" because they are long hex strings that happen to look like SHA-1 hashes.  Well yes but also they are _literally_ SHA-1 hashes of the patch, including the headers.  (And since the parent is one of the headers, the hash includes the hash of the parent, which included the hash of its parent, etc.  It's a long chain of hashing all the way back to the beginning.  Just like Bitcoin!)

A nice property of this hashing is that an individual commit cannot be changed.  You can't go back and just quietly stuff a line into patch **A**, because that would change its hash, and **B** wouldn't point at the changed **A**.  If you wanted to update **B**'s parent, that would change _its_ hash, and on it goes.  Once you have a commit hash, you can be fairly confident that its existing history is immutable.


### Trees

I snuck this term into the above section because it's an actual first-class thing in Git: a directory tree, containing some assortment of files.  Every commit has an associated tree, which reflects the state of the repository as of that commit.  Trees are identified by hashes, too.

You _very_ rarely have to know or care about trees — after many years of using Git I've thought about trees, like, twice.  They're just an implementation detail.  I mention them only because the documentation mentions them, and it's nice to be able to understand what the hell the documentation is talking about.  They come up in two (practical) places in the docs.

1. Some commands are documented as taking a "tree-ish" argument, e.g. using `git checkout` to check out individual files.  This just means "something that Git can get a tree out of".  Since every commit has a tree, you can just use a commit.

2. There are a lot of references to the "working tree".  This is just the _tree_ that you're _working_ in, i.e. the actual copy of the codebase that's sitting on your hard drive.

And that's all you need to know about trees!


### Branches

If you're used to Mercurial, forget about Mercurial branches.  I don't know how they work, and Mercurial users have told me they're such a pain in the ass that no one really uses them any more anyway.

Instead, consider the plight of our wireless driver dev from before.  They want to change the kernel code to add their driver, but to create a patch when they're done, they also need a pristine copy of the code.  A patch lists _differences_, so you need two things to make a patch.

Well, no problem.  When they first download the code, they can stick it in a directory called `master` (because it's the master copy).  Then when they go to work on their driver, they can copy the entire thing into a second directory called `terrible-broadcom-driver`.  To generate the patch, they just diff the two directories.

That's Git branches in a nutshell.

Note that with this approach, no one else knows or cares about your branch names.  After all, you're not sending anyone else your _entire directory_; you're just sending them some _patches_.  The patches don't contain the branch name; they only know their parents.

More technically, a branch is just a name that points to some commit.  (Literally, nothing else.  A branch `foo` is a 41-byte text file containing a commit hash.)  However, a branch has the special property that if you make a new commit while that branch is checked out, the branch name will be bumped to point at the new commit.  Again, this works just like the manual example: if you do some work or apply a patch in your `terrible-broadcom-driver` directory, obviously the new contents of the directory will reflect the new change.

This is why Git is said to have "cheap local branching".  It's cheap because a branch is nothing more than a name; it's local because you aren't forced to keep your branch names synchronized with anyone else's.

Branches add a new wrinkle to our model: now history doesn't have to be linear.  Two different patches can have the same parent!  Of course, you don't really need branches for that — if two people check out the Linux kernel and both make a change, they'll both produce patches with the same parent.  Speaking of which...


### Remotes

"Remote" means "somewhere else", so naturally a Git remote is just a Git repository that exists somewhere else.  Usually this is a central server, but it doesn't have to be; you can work without a central server at all, where several devs just list each other as remotes.

When you first clone a repository, the place you cloned from is set up as a remote called "origin", because it's the origin of your code.  Whoa.

You'll also get all of origin's branches.  Well.  Sort of.  Branch names are local, remember.  If your origin has a branch called `foo`, Git will create a branch for you called `origin/foo` (called a "remote-tracking" branch).  And since you didn't create it, it doesn't show up in `git branch` by default.

You usually don't want to check out remote branches directly, anyway.


### Merging

Say you're our kernel developer again.  You grab the kernel, which is currently at state **B**.  You write your driver, and send off a patch.  But wait!  In the meantime, other people have already had their patches applied!

So now _you_ have: **A** → **B** → **C**

But _Linus_ has: **A** → **B** → **D** → **E** → **F**

Or, to draw it the way the Git docs would, where time flows from left to right:

    :::text
          C            terrible-broadcom-driver
         /
    A---B---D---E---F  origin/master

Well hey, no problem.  The Linux kernel is a huge project, so chances are, none of those new patches touched any of the same files as you.

If we were emailing patches around, we might just say screw it and apply **C** on top of **F**, even though it _says_ it belongs on top of **B**.  But in the Git model, a commit is identified by its hash, which includes its parent.  Changing the parent would require creating a new, different commit, with a different hash.

Instead, Git can just _merge_ these two different views of history together, by creating a new commit with _two_ parents: **C** and **F**.

    :::text
          C-----------.    terrible-broadcom-driver
         /             \
    A---B---D---E---F---G  origin/master

If none of the changes from either side trample on each other, it's a "trivial" merge.  Since nothing new actually changed, the patch in **G** is empty; it only exists to glue **C** and **F** together.

If both sides changed the same parts of the same files in different ways, you have a merge conflict, and you'll have to specify which side wins.  Any change you make then becomes part of the patch in **G**.


### Tags

Tags are names for commits, rather like branches.  However, tags are intended to be _permanent_: they're mostly using for marking version releases.  You can check out a tag, but a tag can't be your "current branch", and a tag will never automatically bump when you make a new commit.

Also, tags are (mostly) global, not namespaced like branches.  They don't change, after all, so it's generally assumed that everyone should agree on what they point to.


## Okay that's great but how do I do anything

What a good question.  There are already [plenty of cheat sheets][github cheat sheet] in the world but here is mine, assuming you want minimal interaction with Git.

### Get some code

`git clone https://github.com/some_jerk/bad_code` will dump that jerk's bad code into a new `bad_code` directory.

When you want to update it, you can `git pull origin master`, which will fetch all the changes and attempt to merge them into your current branch.  If you haven't changed anything, this will just bump your checkout to what's current.

If it's an old checkout and you don't remember whether you've done anything, you might want `git pull --ff-only origin master`, which will only do anything if the pull would be a "fast-forward".  That just means that your side hasn't made any commits and no merge is necessary.  In other words, if you have **A** and your origin has **A** → **B** → **C**, that's a fast forward, because Git only has to pile more commits directly on top of the ones you already have.

### Look at stuff

`git log` will show you a log.  The format is kind of verbose and not great for skimming history.

`git log --oneline --graph --decorate` is a lot nicer at a glance.  You might also want to just install `tig`, which is basically the same thing but you can press Enter on a commit to see a diff right there.

`git log --follow <path>` shows you a log of only changes that touched a particular file (or directory).  The `--follow` means to follow the file's history across renames, and only works for a single file.

`git show <commit>` shows you the patch introduced by a commit.  `git show <commit>:<path>` shows you the state of a file as of a particular commit.

### Actually use this damn thing to make this damn patch for this damn project

`git status` tells you the current state of your codebase: the branch you're on, the changes you've made, etc.

`git branch <name>` creates a new branch based on the commit you have checked out, but doesn't switch to it.  You generally want something like `git checkout -b <name> origin/master` instead, which creates the new branch based on `origin/master` and also checks it out.

`git checkout <branch>` sets your current branch and checks out that state of the codebase.  You can also check out a remote branch, a tag, or an individual commit, but these will unset your current branch, and you'll get warnings about having a "detached HEAD".  That literally means `HEAD` (which is a special name that always points to what you have checked out) doesn't point to a branch, and if you make new commits, they won't have anything pointing to them and will be easy to lose.

`git add` tells Git about new files you've created that you'd like to have in the next commit.

`git rm` tells Git you intend to delete the file, and also deletes it physically.  (Git will refuse if the file has been changed, so this is always reversible.  Also you could just `rm` the file and `git commit -a` will pick up on it.)

`git mv` tells Git you're renaming a file.  (Note that Git doesn't _actually_ store renames; it guesses on-the-fly whether a file has been renamed.)

`git commit -a` will pop open a text editor to ask for a commit message, then make a commit from all the changes you've made to all the files Git knows about.

Something in the Git model I didn't mention yet: there's a thing called the "index" or "staging area" or sometimes "cache".  (I don't know why it needs so many names.)  This is what you've said you're _going_ to commit.  When you use `git add` and friends, any changes to a file (or the whole thing, if it's a new file) are _staged_ and show up in their own section in `git status`.  Unstaged changes are listed beneath them.  If you use a plain `git commit` without `-a`, only staged changes become part of the commit.  This is pretty useful at times, because it lets you do a bunch of exploratory work and then parcel it into several commits for future archaeologists.  (If you're feeling fancy, look into `git add -p`.)  But you can just use `git commit -a` every time if you want.  Hell, you don't even need `git add`; you can just pass a list of files to `git commit`.


### Okay now how do I get it anywhere

By pushing, which just means bumping one or more branches on a particular remote.  Git will only let you do a fast-forward when pushing — you can't even automatically merge with a push.  If you try to push and get a complaint about "non fast-forward" push, you just have to pull first and then try again.  (But chances are you're using GitHub and pull requests, where you push to a private branch, and GitHub does trivial merges for you.)

`git push <remote> <branch>` will push your branch to a branch of the same name to a remote.  If you're using a GitHub fork, then you probably have a single remote called "origin" which is your fork, and you are probably just working on the master branch.  So you can do `git push origin master` and everything will be okay.

You can also do `git push` bare, which will usually do something useful.  The default behavior for this has changed a couple times in recent releases, so I'm out of the habit of using it, but the current behavior is pretty safe and is basically: push the current branch to a remote branch of the same name.


### Merge conflicts

If you do a merge, or a pull, or (God forbid) a rebase, it's possible your changes will conflict with someone else's.  Git will stop the merge with "Automatic merge failed; blah blah error message".  If you look in `git status`, you'll see a new section for conflicting files.  You have to fix those to finish the merge, or really do much of anything.

Pop open a conflicting file and you'll find something like this:

    :::text
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    something you changed
    =======
    something someone else changed
    >>>>>>> origin/master

(The `diff3` conflict style can improve this somewhat; see the section on configuration below.)

This tells you that two people changed the same lines in the same file, in different ways, and Git doesn't know what the final result should look like.  The first part, labeled `HEAD`, is what your copy of the file looks like (`HEAD` is just a special pointer to the commit or branch you have checked out); the second part is what the other branch's copy of the file looks like.

If you're lucky, the "conflict" is just some jackass fixing a whitespace error, or both of you adding imports in the same place, or some other trivial thing.  Edit the file to look how you want, and `git add` it to tell Git that it's ready to go.  Once all the conflicts are fixed and all the files are `git add`ed, do a plain `git commit` to finish the merge.

If you're unlucky, someone did a huge refactor while you were fixing a small bug and the entire file conflicts and you are now completely screwed.  You may want to `git merge --abort` to cancel the merge, create a new branch based on current `master`, and re-apply your changes manually.

A couple miscellaneous notes:

* **Double-check that you've actually fixed all the conflicts.**  Git **WILL NOT** prevent you from committing conflict markers!

* Sometimes, the conflict is that one side edited a file, and the other side _deleted_ that file.  When this happens, Git will tell you who did the deletion.  I mostly encounter this when doing an automated reformatting or refactor or whatever, in which case I don't actually care about the file that was deleted; if that's the case, you can just `git rm` it.

* There's a semi-interactive `git mergetool` command you can use during a conflict, which will pop open your merge resolution program for each conflicting file.  For me, that's `vimdiff`, which I just never got in the habit of using, so I don't use this very often.  YMMV.


### Oh my god what have I done

You copied and pasted some asshole's `git` invocation from Stack Overflow, and now _everything is broken_.  Don't panic!  And definitely don't paste some _other_ asshole's claimed solution.

If your working copy or index are just completely screwed up, you can use `git reset --hard` to undo all your uncommitted changes.  But **do not use it lightly**, since it's naturally a destructive operation.

If you were doing some interactive multi-step thing like `git rebase` or `git cherry-pick` and it's gone horribly wrong, `git status` will tell you, and e.g. `git rebase --abort` will bail and put you back where you started.

If you think you've lost commits somehow, you might find them in `git reflog`.

Absolute worst case, you can always get your work out as patches with `git show` and start over with a fresh clone.


### Also, some syntax stuff

Anywhere you need to name a commit, you can use the name of a branch, because a branch always unambiguously names a commit.  A tag also works.

`HEAD` is a special kinda-sorta branch name that just refers to whatever you have checked out right now.

There's a whole bunch of syntax for specifying commits or ranges of commits.  You can peruse `man gitrevisions` at your leisure.  The most useful ones are:

* `foo^` is the (first) parent of `foo`.  Most commonly used as `HEAD^`.  Note that `^` is special in a lot of shells and might need escaping.
* `foo..bar` is a range, and means everything _after_ `foo`, up to and including `bar`.

There's more of this in `man gitrevisions`, but honestly I've never used 80% of it.

A lot of commands can take both commit names and paths, which is a little ambiguous, especially since branch names can contain slashes.  All such commands should respect the convention of using a `--` argument to mean "everything after here is a filename".


## Useful configuration

I don't have much in [my .gitconfig](https://github.com/eevee/rc/blob/master/.gitconfig), but I'm pretty fond of a few things in there, so maybe you will enjoy them too.  If you use Git very heavily at all, it might be worth taking a flick through `man git-config`, for one of its many twiddles may address an aggravating UX problem you have.

You can query your Git configuration with `git config foo.bar.baz`.  You can also edit it with `git config --global foo.bar.baz value`, where the `--global` will change your `~/.gitconfig` file (which applies to any repo you work with), and omitting it will change `.git/config` (which only applies to that repository).

_Or_, you can crack `~/.gitconfig` open in a text editor, because it's a goddamn INI file and those are not rocket science.  Let's pretend we're doing that instead.

### Before you do ANYTHING, set your name and email

As we know, every Git commit has a name and an email address attached to it, because Git was devised by people who literally cannot imagine any workflow not centered on email.  (Yes, this means your GitHub email address is effectively public, even if it's not obviously exposed on the website.)

If you don't tell Git your name, _it will have to guess_, and it will guess badly.  It will take your name from the "real name" field of `/etc/passwd` (which might be okay), and it will take your email from your login name plus the hostname of your computer (which is certain to be utter nonsense, unless you are on a university server and it's 1983).  And you can't fix them retroactively because they're part of a commit, and commits are immutable-ish.

So the first three lines of your `.gitconfig` should probably fix those:

    :::text
    [user]
        name = Eevee (Lexy Munroe)
        email = eevee.git@veekun.com

Easy peasy.

### The default colors are horrendous garbage

A previous revision of this article suggested that `git status` shows changed files in green, and staged files in yellow.  Someone expressed surprise at these colors, because they always see the reverse.

Some brief investigation revealed that I have actually had the colors customized in my `.gitconfig` for my entire Git career, and in fact I _had no idea_ what the default colors were.  So I commented them out and played with Git for a while.

What I saw horrified and dismayed me.  Please just trust me when I say that you should absolutely blindly paste this block of color definitions into your `.gitconfig`.

    :::text
    [color "branch"]
        current = yellow reverse
        local = yellow
        remote = green
    [color "diff"]
        meta = yellow bold
        frag = magenta bold
        old = red bold
        new = green bold
    [color "status"]
        added = yellow
        changed = green
        untracked = cyan

### Conflict style

The only other real twiddle of note in my `.gitconfig` is this:

    :::text
    [merge]
        conflictstyle = diff3

Usually, a merge conflict appears like this:

    :::text
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    what you changed it to
    =======
    what they changed it to
    >>>>>>> master

For simple cases, this is enough, and all is well.  For less simple cases, this can be an aggravating nightmare as you try to figure out what the hell both of you did.

Enter `diff3`, which changes merge conflicts to appear like this:

    :::text
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    what you changed it to
    |||||||
    what it was originally
    =======
    what they changed it to
    >>>>>>> master

At its best, this is _incredibly_ helpful.  At its worst, you can just ignore it.  I don't think there's much reason not to have this turned on, and I'm amazed it's not the default.


## Some assumptions you might make that you should not make

Git _is not_ a friendly project management tool.  Git is a stupid content tracker.

Rather, Git is a weird filesystem, and it has a bunch of tools like `rm` and `ls`.  The lower-level you go, the fewer assumptions Git will make about what you're trying to do, and the less it will try to stop you from doing something bizarre.  If you take only one thing away from this post, let it be this: **Git was designed for people who already 100% understood it — the people who wrote it.**  It's getting better about this, but this is the reason for a lot of its rough edges.

For the sake of nudging you out of the weeds, here are some assumptions you might already be making that you should not be making:

* A commit doesn't have to have one parent.  It can have two (if it's a merge).  Or three, or more (if it's an "octopus" merge).  Or _zero_ (if it's an initial commit).

* You can have a remote that has _zero_ commits in common with your repository.  There's nothing strictly defining two repositories as containing the "same" codebase, or enforcing that they never interact.  It's just usually not that useful.  (One possible use case: I've merged two projects into the same repository, without losing any of the history, by adding one as a remote of the other and just merging their histories together.)

* Similarly, you can have two branches in the same repository that have _zero_ commits in common.  (Which means you can have more than one initial commit!)  This is how GitHub stores "GitHub pages": they go on a separate `gh-pages` branch inside your repository, with a completely separate history.

* Commits don't know what branch they were created on.  A branch points to a single commit; a commit doesn't point to a branch, ever.  You can guess well enough for most practical cases, though.

* Git tracks files, _not_ directories.  You can't store an empty directory in Git.  The usual workaround is to stick a zero-byte file named `.keep` or something in the directory, and commit that file.

* The documentation does not necessarily list switches, or command forms, or really much of anything in order of usefulness.  For example, the most fundamental command is arguably `git commit`, and the third switch documented is `-C` which is some curious merge thing that I don't believe I have ever used.  `-m`, which allows you to _write a commit message_, comes in at sixteenth place.


## Footguns to beware

Git is basically a weird filesystem, and the Git commands are basically weird filesystem commands.  Just like `ls` and `rm` are equivalently opaque if you don't already know what they do, Git commands don't have any obvious tells for when they're dangerous or not.

So here are some things that are dangerous, and how to use them safely, or at least how to use them not quite as dangerously.

### git rm

Well, obviously.  In this case Git is nice enough to refuse to remove a file that has uncommitted changes, so you _probably_ won't do much damage with this.

### git checkout

`git checkout` switches branches, but on a more fundamental level, what it does is check out _files_.  You can use it as `git checkout [commit] -- <files...>` to check out some files, as of a particular commit.  The commit defaults to your current branch, so the way to undo a change you've made to a file (but not yet committed) is `git checkout -- <path>`.

But this is naturally a destructive operation, with no confirmation.  So be very sure you're checking out the files you think you are.

You might want to try passing the `-p` switch, which will interactively prompt you about discarding each particular chunk of each file.  (Several other commands take `-p`, including `git add`, which makes it possible to make several changes to a single file and only commit some of them.  Pretty slick.)

### git reset

"Reset" is a weird command.  It basically adjusts the state of your current branch, the index, and your working tree.

The dangerous part is `git reset --hard <files...>`, which will discard your work with no prompt, just like `git checkout`.  There's no "dry run" option, either.  Be very careful with it, and triple-check that you don't have anything you want to keep first.

A safer option is `git stash`, which will stuff all your uncommitted changes into a sort of temporary faux commit thing not tied to your branch.  You can see them with `git stash list`, and if you realize you wanted to keep some of that work, you can re-apply a stashed patch with `git stash apply`.

### git rebase

I don't care what _anyone_ says.  **Do not use anything that says "rebase" unless you understand _exactly_ what you are doing.**

"Rebase" is for _editing history_.  But you can't edit history, because of the whole hashing thing.  Rather, `git rebase` creates a _new_ history.

Say you have **A** → **B** → **C**, where **C** is your own commit, and **B** is the latest commit in `origin/master`.  You go to push, and, oh no!  There's already a new commit **D** on the server.  So you have this:

    :::text
          .---C  master
         /
    A---B---D    origin/master

You could merge here...  _or_ you could do a rebase.  Fundamentally, "rebasing" means recreating a commit with a different parent.  Git will take the patch that's in **C**, apply it on top of **D**, fix any line numbers and ask you to resolve any conflicts (just like doing a merge), and then create a _new_ commit from the result.  This can't still be commit **C**, because the parent is part of the commit hash, and the parent changed.  Instead you get a commit **C'**.  (The new hash doesn't necessarily resemble the old one in any way; the apostrophe, pronounced "prime", is a convention borrowed from math.)

So now you have:

    :::text
          .---C
         /
    A---B---D         origin/master
             \
              .---C'  master

Your commit used to be _based on_ **B**, but you've rewritten it to be _based on_ **D**.  Hence, _rebase_.  I guess.

Anyway, now you can do a regular fast-forward push to `origin`.

Notice that **C** still exists, but it no longer has a name.  Git keeps dangling commits like this around for 30 days (visible in `git reflog`) just in case you make a mistake, and deletes them during garbage collection.

Rebasing can be _very_ disruptive, and _should not be done lightly_.  Definitely **never** rebase commits that you've already published in any way — if anyone else has work based on your original commit **C**, it becomes a huge pain in the ass to update their work to be based on **C'** instead.  And if they don't, you might end up with both **C** and **C'** in your history, or they might conflict with _each other_, or who knows what.  I've seen misuse of `git rebase` turn a linear branch with four commits into a tangled mess of some fifteen commits all merged constantly with copies of each other.

And there are further complications, like: **C** might be more than one commit, **C** might include _merge_ commits, you might edit **C** while you're at it, etc.  It can get pretty gnarly pretty fast, and it's not necessarily obvious how to resolve a wacky problem if you're not totally sure what Git is doing.

If you do decide to experiment with rebasing, one final warning.  In a merge, your branch is "ours", and the foreign branch is "theirs".  But in a rebase, this is _backwards_ — you're starting from the foreign branch, and re-adding your own commits on _top_ of it, even if you thought you were rebasing your current branch.  So from Git's perspective, your branch is "theirs", and the foreign branch is "ours"!  This affects brute-force resolution with `git checkout --ours`, it switches around the patches in conflict markers, and it reverses "them" and "us" when describing conflicts in `git status`.  One more reason not to rebase unless you're totally sure you understand what's going on!

If you _do_ screw up a rebase, you can always `git rebase --abort`.  Or, if the rebase has already finished, you can refer to the old version of the branch with the special syntax `branchname@{1}`, which means "what `branchname` pointed to before the last time it changed".  You'd have to use `git reset --hard` to force the branch back, though, and yikes.

### `--force`

Usually seen as an argument to `git push` after a rebase.  Be super duper careful, since this will blindly overwrite whatever is on the remote.  If you're reading this article you probably have no good reason to force-push.  And if you think you do, you probably still don't, because Git 2.0 has `--force-with-lease` which at least defends against race conditions.

### Committing passwords, large files, etc

Git history is a chain going all the way back to the beginning of time.  If you commit passwords or very large files, _they are in history forever_.  Even if you delete something, it lives on forever in your repository.  Git repositories, as a general rule, do not ever get smaller.  And everyone, as a general rule, grabs your entire history when they clone.

The only way to get rid of something for good is to effectively rebase your _entire history_ starting from the bad commit.  (You'd rebase that history onto the same point, but you'd edit or delete the bad commit.  That would change the bad commit's hash, so every subsequent commit would change, too.)

You really don't want to have to do that.  Not only is it a huge pain, but it requires coordination with everyone else using your repository — after all, they still have copies of the original history, which they'll need to get rid of as well.  Or you'll end up with the old history merged back into the new history!

### Forgetting you're in the middle of something

Git is a command-line tool, not an interactive program, so it's possible to be in the middle of a multi-step process and then...  forget about it.

Perhaps you tried to do a rebase, but it conflicted.  You got bored while resolving the conflicts, and you went home for the night.  You come back in the morning, all ready to work!  You made some commits all morning, and _then_ you realized that Git still thinks you're in the middle of a rebase, because committing while rebasing is actually a perfectly reasonable thing to do.

There's always some way to fix whatever mess you get yourself into, but the best fix is prevention: run `git status` nigh constantly and be sure you're in the state you think you are.


## That's all I got

This is not a Git introduction for people who expect to be using Git heavily in the near future; this is a pile of notes for diving in head-first and maybe getting some useful work done without reading piles of documentation first.

Regardless, I hope some of this is useful, or at least makes other Git resources more intelligible!

If you are just dying to learn more about Git, the Internet is overflowing with other people trying to explain it.  I defer to [GitHub's list of articles](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/).
