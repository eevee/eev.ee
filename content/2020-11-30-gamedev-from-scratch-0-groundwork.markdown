You may recall that I once had the ambitious idea to write a book on game development, walking the reader through making simple games _from scratch_ in a variety of different environments, starting from simple level editors and culminating in some "real" engine.

That never quite materialized.  As it turns out, writing a book is a huge slog, publishers want almost all of the proceeds, and LaTeX is an endless rabbit hole of distractions that probably consumed more time than actually writing.  Also, a book about programming with no copy/paste or animations or hyperlinks kind of sucks.

I thus present to you Plan B: a series of blog posts.  This is a narrative reconstruction of a small game I made recently, [Star Anise Chronicles: Oh No Wheres Twig??]({filename}/release/2020-05-10-star-anise-chronicles-oh-no-wheres-twig.markdown).  It took me less than two weeks and I kept quite a few snapshots of the game's progress, so you'll get to see a somewhat realistic jaunt through the process of creating a small game from very nearly nothing.

And unlike your typical programming tutorial, I can _guarantee_ that this won't get you as far as a half-assed Mario clone and then abruptly end.  The game has original art and sound, a title screen, an ending, cutscenes, dialogue, UI, and more — so this series will necessarily cover how all of that came about.  I will tell you why I made particular decisions, mention planned features I cut, show you the tradeoffs I made, and confess when I made life harder for myself.  You know, all the stuff you _actually go through_ when doing game development (or, frankly, any kind of software development).

The target audience is (ideally) anyone who knows what a computer is, so hopefully you can follow along no matter what your experience level.  Enjoy!

This is **part zero**, and it's mostly introductory stuff.  Please don't skip it!  I promise there's some meat in the latter half.

Here's what you have to look forward to (though it is of course a WIP until the series is done).  Occasionally there'll be a _snapshot_ of the game, but these were made on a whim during development and aren't particularly meaningful as milestones.

For reference, I started working on the game the morning of April 29, and I released it the night of May 10, for a total of twelve days.

## Introduction

**This is not a tutorial.**  Please set your expectations accordingly.  Honestly, I don't even like tutorials — too many of them are framed as something that will teach you a skill, but then only tell you what buttons to press to recreate what the author already made, with no insight as to why they made their decisions or even why they pressed those particular buttons.  They often leave you hanging, with no clear next steps, no explanation of what to adjust to get different results.

I've never seen a platformer tutorial that actually produced a finished game.  Most of them give you just enough to have a stock sprite (poorly) jump around on the screen, perhaps collect some coins, and that's it.  How do you fix the controls, add cutscenes, even make a damn title screen?  That's all left up to you.

This is something much better than a tutorial: a _story_.  I made a video game — a real, complete video game — and I will tell you everything I can remember doing _and thinking_ along the way.  Every careful decision, every rushed tradeoff, every boneheaded mistake, every weird diversion.  I don't guarantee that anything I did is necessarily a _good_ idea, but everything I did is _an_ idea, and sometimes that's all you need to get the gears turning.

If you're interested in making a video games, I don't promise that this series will _teach_ you anything.  But with a little effort, you can probably _learn_ something.  And to be frank, if you're starting with zero knowledge but still manage to muddle through the whole series, you've got more than enough curiosity and determination to succeed at whatever you feel like doing.

The game in question is [Star Anise Chronicles: Oh No Wheres Twig??](content/release/2020-05-10-star-anise-chronicles-oh-no-wheres-twig.markdown), which I made with the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).  (If you are from the future, I specifically used version 0.2.0i; later versions may have added conveniences I'm not using.)  This is not a whizbang fully-featured game engine like [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) or [Unity](https://unity.com/).  If I want to draw something, I have to draw it myself.  If I want physics, I have to write them myself.  If I want shaders...  well, that's not going to happen, but a little ingenuity can still go a long way.

And that kind of ingenuity is what makes game development appealing to me in the first place.  It's one big puzzle: given the tools I have, what's the most interesting thing I can make with the least amount of hapless flailing?  That question will come up a number of times in this series.

If any of this sounds appealing to you, keep reading!  Follow along if you can.  You can get the PICO-8 (tragically not open source) for $15, and chances are you already own it — it was in the itch.io [BLM bundle](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality), so if you bought that, you're free to download it whenever you want.

### Conventions

In order to replicate the experience of reading the book, I'm porting these little "admonition" boxes from what I'd started.  I have a somewhat meandering writing style, and hopefully these will help get tangents out of the main text, while also better highlighting warnings and gotchas.

Here they are, in no particular order:

<aside class="aside--well-actually" markdown="1">
This indicates that I have just told you a little white lie for the sake of simplicity, like a math teacher fibbing that you can't take the square root of negative numbers, but my conscience will not let it go uncommented upon.

(Actually, Twitter stopped using eggs as default avatars in April 2017.)
</aside>

<aside class="aside--note-from-future" markdown="1">
While I did just accurately describe my thought process _at the time_, I have arrived from the future to let you know I actually made a very poor decision.  Tragically, my past self cannot see this warning, and we must now together watch her stumble into her impending doom.

<aside class="aside--computers-are-bad" markdown="1">
Computers are wonderful tools, but sometimes they are dead set on sabotaging you and everything you hold dear for no good reason.  Beware!  There's some asinine problem here that has no good reason to exist.

I reserve the right to invent more, if they're needed and/or funny.

### Setting expectations, again

Game development is about a lot more than programming, but this _will_ contain an awful lot of programming.  The PICO-8 in particular tends to blur the lines between code and assets if you want to do anything fancy.

That puts me in a tricky position as an author.  I want this to be accessible to people with little or no programming experience, but I can't realistically explain every single line of code I write, or this series will never end (and will be more noise than signal for intermediate programmers).

Thus, I'm **trusting you** to look up basic concepts on your own if you need to.  I'm writing this to fill a perceived gap, so I'll try to focus on the gaps — finding resources on from-scratch collision detection is a crapshoot, but the web is awash in explanations of what a "variable" is.  PICO-8 uses a programming language called [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) which is pretty simple and easy to pick up, so if you're having trouble, maybe thumb through the [Programming in Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html) book a bit too.

Of course, if you're just here for the ride and not too worried about writing your own game, you can skip ahead whenever you like.  I'm not your mom.

(Oh, and if you've used Lua before, you should know that PICO-8's Lua has been modified from stock Lua.  The precise list of changes would be a big block of stuff in the middle of this already too long intro, so I've put it [at the bottom](#appendix-pico-8-lua-extensions).  The upshot is: numbers are fixed-point instead of floating-point, you can use compound assignment, and the standard library is almost completely different.)

That's probably enough words with no pictures.  Time to get started.


## The PICO-8

<div class="prose-full-illustration">
<img src="{static}/media/gamedev-from-scratch/pico8-startup.png" alt="A fresh PICO-8 window, with white old-school text on a small black screen and a command prompt">
</div>

As mentioned, this is a game built with the PICO-8.  I promised I'd tell you a story, but I can't even explain why I chose PICO-8 if you don't know what the thing _is_.

PICO-8 is a "fantasy console" — a genre that it pioneered.  It has a fixed screen size, its own palette, its own font, a little chiptune synthesizer, its own idea of what buttons the player can press, and so on.  It's like an emulator for an 8-bit handheld that doesn't actually exist, plus a bunch of relatively friendly tools for making cartridges for that handheld.  It even has some arbitrary limitations to preserve that aesthetic.  (I carefully avoid calling them _artificial_ limitations, because there _are_ some technical reasons for them, and a lot of programmers do a thing with their face if you say "artificial" to them.  Like you've just spat in their lunch.)

If you've got PICO-8 open, you can type `splore` at this little command prompt to open the cartridge explorer, which lets you download and play cartridges that have been posted to the PICO-8 BBS (forum).  You might want to try a few to get a sense of what the PICO-8 can do, though bear in mind that some of the best games are incredible feats of ingenuity and not representative.  A good place to start is the "featured" tab, which lists games that...  I believe have been hand-picked as high-quality?  Some suggestions:

- Star Anise Chronicles: Oh No Wheres Twig is in there, as is our older (and first!) game [Under Construction](https://eevee.itch.io/under-construction).

- The original PICO-8 version of Celeste, if you weren't aware of its origins.

- Dusk Child, one of the earliest games I played and a big inspiration — it's pretty and expansive, but doesn't do anything I couldn't figure out.

- Just One Boss, which is just so damn _crisp_.

- Dank Tomb, a dungeon crawler with absolutely beautiful lighting effects.

- PicoHot, which is absolute fucking nonsense how dare you.

Note that when playing most games, the PICO-8 functions as though it only had six buttons: a directional pad bound to the arrow keys, and "O" and "X" buttons bound to the <kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>X</kbd> keys.  Most games refer to those buttons by name (the PICO-8 font has built-in symbols for them) rather than keyboard key, since you might be playing on a controller or with some other bindings.  You can always press <kbd>Esc</kbd> for the built-in menu.

...

Had fun?  Great!  Pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> takes you back to the prompt.  From there, you can press <kbd>Esc</kbd> again to switch to the editor (and vice versa).

Now, this is not a PICO-8 tutorial.  But the PICO-8's design and constraints _immensely_ impact how much I could do and how I planned to do it, so I can't very well explain my thought process without that context.  Luckily, all the code and assets for the last game you played stay loaded, so I might as well give you the whirlwind tour.  Even if you're not following along with an actual copy of PICO-8, you should keep reading so you understand what I've got to work with.

### Code editor

<div class="prose-full-illustration">
<img src="{static}/media/gamedev-from-scratch/pico8-editor-code.png" alt="A very small text editor, populated with code">
</div>

This is the code editor, a very tiny text editor.  If you've loaded Under Construction, feel free to page through and see what I did.  (Keyboard shortcuts help a lot; see [the manual](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=manual) for a full list of them.  There are also some [cheat sheets](https://wh0am1.dev/pico8-api/) floating around, though they focus more on programming capabilities.)

You may have noticed the ominous `7695/8192` in the bottom right.  That's hinting at one of the PICO-8's limitations: the _token count_.  A cartridge's source code cannot exceed 8192 tokens, or it will not run at all.  A "token" is, in general terms, a single "word" of code — a number like `133`, a name like `animframedelay`, an operator like `+`, a keyword like `function`, and so on.  The term "token" is borrowed from the field of parsing, which is an entire tangent you are free to look up yourself.

The PICO-8's definition of "token" is slightly different from its typical usage and includes a few exceptions.  The common Lua keywords `local` and `end` don't count at all; nor do commas, periods, semicolons, or comments.  A string of any length is one token.  A _pair_ of parentheses, brackets, or braces only counts as one token.  Negative literal numbers (e.g., `-25`) are one token.

<aside class="aside--fascinating-tangent" markdown="1">
I suspect the reason for this is to emulate, very roughly, what it was like to write code for 8-bit hardware.  If you've read any of my posts on my brief (and aborted) dive into Game Boy development, you've seen it was all written in assembly, where everything is built out of very simple terse instruction like `add a, 8`.  More math means more instructions, and each instruction takes up a byte or two.  In PICO-8, more math means more _tokens_, so it works out similarly.  Jumping to a label in assembly only needs space for the jump, not the label, so the Lua equivalent of `end` doesn't take a token.  Nesting is meaningless in assembly, so parentheses only count as one (eh).  Reading from fields is an address addition plus a read, so the `.` in the middle shouldn't count.  And so on.

Ironically, there is _vastly_ more space on a Game Boy than in the PICO-8 — the original Pokémon games had a whopping half a meg to work with, eight times more than the PICO-8's 64KiB.
</aside>

The token limit is the most oppressive of the limits on your code, but there are two others.  The full size of your code cannot exceed 64KiB, though in practice I've never come anywhere near that size and I think you'd only approach it if you were committing some serious shenanigans.  More of concern, the _compressed_ size of your code cannot exceed 15,616 bytes.  I do wind up battling that one near the end of this project (as I did with Under Construction), and it can be extra frustrating since it's hard to gauge exactly what impact any particular change will have on compression.  Thankfully, and unlike with the token limit, the PICO-8 will still run a game that's over the compressed size; it just physically cannot export it to a cartridge.

Incidentally, you can use <kbd>Alt</kbd> and an arrow key to move between the editors.

### Sprite editor

<div class="prose-full-illustration">
<img src="{static}/media/gamedev-from-scratch/pico8-editor-sprite.png" alt="A very small sprite editor, showing the mole player character from Under Construction">
</div>

Here we have a tiny pixel art editor.  As you might have guessed, the "native" size for a tile is 8 × 8 pixels, though you can use the bottom of the two sliders to edit bigger blocks of tiles at a time.  (The screen is 128 × 128 pixels, or 16 × 16 tiles.)  You have at your disposal a spritesheet of 256 such tiles, which are arranged at the bottom of the screen in four tabs of 64 tiles each.  `001` here is the tile number.  Each tile has its own set of 8 flags you can toggle on and off, which are represented by the eight circles just above the tabs; here, all the flags are off.  The flags do nothing by themselves, but you can use them for whatever you like, and they turn out to be pretty handy.

The palette is 16 colors, as shown.  There are 16 more colors on the "secret palette" which I'll be dipping into later, but you can only swap them in; you can never have more than 16 distinct colors on screen at the same time.  This is reminiscent of how some early systems actually worked.

### Map editor

<div class="prose-full-illustration">
<img src="{static}/media/gamedev-from-scratch/pico8-editor-map.png" alt="A very small map editor, showing the upper left of a cave-like area from Under Construction">
</div>

The map editor edits the map.  You only get one; if you want to carve it up somehow, that's up to you.  It's extremely simple: you have a grid of 128 × 64 tiles (that's 8 × 4 screenfuls), and you can pick which tile goes in each cell.  No layers, no stacking, no two things in the same cell.  You can pan around with the middle mouse button and zoom with the mouse wheel (or check the manual for the keyboard equivalents).

The especially nice thing about the map is that you can draw entire blocks of it with the built-in `map` function, which saves a whole lot of tokens over drawing a bunch of tiles by hand.  Even if you're making a game that doesn't have a literal map, it's a convenient way to define and draw blocks of multiple tiles.

<aside class="aside--fascinating-tangent" markdown="1">
Actual hardware like the Game Boy required you to put "most" of your tiles in a grid, with a limited number drawn on top wherever you want.  The PICO-8 doesn't have this restriction — you can draw whatever you want at any position — but the convenience of drawing tiles en masse from the map still acts as gentle guidance towards that aesthetic.
</aside>

The catch is that the bottom half of the spritesheet and the bottom half of the map are _shared_, so you can't actually have a full map and a full set of tiles in the same cartridge.  You could have a full 8 × 4 map and 128 tiles, or you could have a full set of 256 tiles but only an 8 × 2 map, or you can split the space up somehow, but you can't have the maximum of both.  Drawing in the bottom half of one will immediately update the other with garbage.  It's beautiful, actually, if you're into the aesthetic of arbitrary memory being drawn as tiles.

If you have a cartridge open, you can see this yourself: check out the bottom half of the map (it helps to use <kbd>Tab</kbd> or the buttons in the upper left to hide the tile palette) and tabs 2 and 3 of the sprite editor.  If they're not both completely empty, _something_ will be full of garbage.  Try drawing in one or the other, if you like, and you'll see the other update with junk.  That's the memory layout of pixel data being interpreted as map data, or vice versa.  Cool, right?

<aside class="aside--fascinating-tangent" markdown="1">
If you hadn't guessed by now, the PICO-8 has its own faux ROM/RAM layout, which you can even inspect and modify directly, so all these numbers aren't chosen just for kicks.  You can't have more than 256 tiles because the map uses one byte per tile; you can't have both a full map and full spritesheet because the shared section literally occupies the same area of ROM, and there's no room for expansion because the 16-bit address space is full!  This is the same reason the compressed code limit is the oddball size of 15,616 bytes — that's how much space was left over once everything else was accounted for.

Boy, I sure am using these things a lot already.
</aside>

### Sound editor

<div class="prose-full-illustration">
<img src="{static}/media/gamedev-from-scratch/pico8-editor-sound-pitch.png" alt="A very small sound editor, showing a sound as bars representing pitch">
<img src="{static}/media/gamedev-from-scratch/pico8-editor-sound-tracker.png" alt="The same sound, but shown using a tracker-like interface">
</div>

The sound editor (or SFX editor) does a lot, despite being very simple conceptually, and it can be a little intimidating if you've never worked with sound or music before.  These screenshots are the two display modes, "pitch mode" and "tracker mode" — allegedly pitch mode is more suitable for sound effects and tracker mode is more suitable for music, but I honestly have no idea how anyone does anything in pitch mode, and I use tracker mode for both.  Your mileage may vary.  As with the map editor, use <kbd>Tab</kbd> or the buttons in the top-left to switch views.

There are 64 sound effects to work with, each consisting of 32 notes played by a little chiptune synth.  Notes consist of a pitch (i.e., the actual note being played), an instrument, the volume, and an optional effect.

I could say an awful lot about sound and chiptunes and what any of this means, but this is not a chiptuning tutorial, so I'll save that for when I actually made some sounds for the game.  Do feel free to mess around here, though.

There's also a music editor, but all it does is arrange several sound effects to play at the same time, so it's not especially interesting.

And that's everything at my disposal!  I guess that means it's time to get started, for real.  Go back to the command prompt and use `reboot` to get a fresh blank cartridge, if you're planning on following along.


## Inspiration

The first step to making a game is having a game you want to make.

I started on this at the end of April, after a very rushed month spent preparing the [Steam release of Cherry Kisses]({filename}/release/2020-11-30-cherry-kisses-on-steam.markdown).  I was pretty pumped about having just published something in a very visible place for the first time, and I wanted to keep that energy going, but I didn't want to immediately jump into an even larger thing.  I wanted to make something small, something self-contained, something I could do entirely on my own.  (My spouse is the better artist by far, and they did all the art for Cherry Kisses.)

The PICO-8 came to mind as the obvious platform to use.  For one, the limitations make it very difficult for a game's scope to balloon very far; you will simply run out of space and _have_ to cut some ideas.  For two, the art and audio are fairly low-resolution, so I wouldn't have much opportunity to endlessly fuss over trying to make them perfect.  For three, it runs in a browser, even on phones, so the resulting game would be easy for anyone to play.  (Having to download a thing will discourage a surprising amount of casual passersby, especially if the thing is fairly small and thus low-reward.)

<aside class="aside--well-actually" markdown="1">
It's possible to make a PICO-8 game that spans multiple cartridges, so a game could be arbitrarily large!  But I've never tried it and am never going to, because having a hard cap on how much stuff I can do is much of the appeal of PICO-8 for me.
</aside>

I also just find the PICO-8 endlessly charming, and I hadn't touched it in a couple years and was curious how it had improved in the interim.  It's great for a game started on a whim, too, since I can jump in and start slapping stuff on the screen without worrying that my ADHD brain will start fretting over how everything should be organized.

That only left the question of _what_ to make.

Two and a half years prior — almost three, now — I'd started on a platformer where you played as Star Anise, my cat's fursona.  It was intended to be a goofy Metroidvania where you collected cat-themed powers, ran around defeating little monsters, collected useless garbage, and generally left a trail of minor mayhem in your wake.  Sadly, it was interrupted by real-life events and we haven't touched it since.

<div class="prose-full-illustration">
<img src="{static}/media/gamedev-from-scratch/star-anise-original-sample.gif" alt="A clip of a pastel game where a small cat meows loudly and shoots a bubble gun that knocks jars off of shelves.">
</div>

I loved how this game was shaping up!  It was so goofy, but its goofiness really opened up the design.  Star Anise is great to build a game around.  I can give him all manner of strong yet absurd motivations, and as long as I tie them to something vaguely cat-themed, they'll be memorable and feel sensible.  I can load him up with goofy cat-themed powers without needing any kind of justification, because he's a cat, and everyone knows cats are basically magic anyway.  He has a group of friends already built in: other cats.  And most importantly, he's just fun to play as, because everything he does is ridiculous and overboard, but you never have to feel guilty about his mischief because he's a cat.

It's such a good hook.  I've wanted to make a whole series of little Star Anise games, but the furthest I'd gotten so far was [Star Anise Chronicles: Escape from the Chamber of Despair](https://eevee.itch.io/anise-escape-despair) — which is good, but is also a text adventure, one of the most impenetrable genres imaginable.

So why not take another crack at it?  I couldn't fit the entire original vision into a PICO-8 game, but surely I'd have enough room for Star Anise, a few of the abilities we'd come up with, and some things to interact with.  At long last, a Star Anise platformer.

You could say the stars aligned.  The stars.  Get it?  Like Star Anise.  Okay.

## From zero to something

Before I could do anything, I needed some art.  Okay, that's not true; I could have boxes moving around on the screen, but I've done this enough that I am beyond tired of boxes.  If I'm gonna make a Star Anise game then I want to have Star Anise on the damn screen right from the start.

And right away I had to make some decisions.  I wanted this to be a _little bit_ Metroidvania style, where Star Anise gained his handful of powers throughout the game and could then explore new areas.

That meant I wanted as much map space as humanly possible, so from the very beginning I knew the sprite/map split I wanted: all map.  32 screens, but only 128 sprites.

And that made several other decisions, automatically.  I probably wouldn't have enough sprite space to include a gun and enemies and whatnot, but a puzzler would let me skip all of that.

This is why I chose PICO-8!  The game basically decided its own design with only minimal input from me.  Puzzle platformer with some powerups.

Now, to draw Star Anise, which meant deciding how big he should be.  A very conspicuous part of his design is his huge helmet, which wouldn't fit especially well in a single 8×8 tile, or even in two of them stacked.  I decided to go one bigger and make a 2×3 block.

<img src="{static}/media/gamedev-from-scratch/v1-sprite.png" alt="A charming little Star Anise sprite, with some extra bits next to him">
</div>

This wasn't especially complicated to draw.  At this size, it feels like a lot of the sprites draw themselves, too.  It did help that I'd already seen my spouse's interpretation of Star Anise from the prototype game above, but I think the general lesson there is to look at existing art that's similar to what you want to draw and reverse-engineer the bits that make it work.  Here, I made a big circle, squeezed in the narrowest possible face — a pixel each for the eyes, then three pixels for spacing — and gave him a rectangle for his body.  Toss a couple stars into the inside of the helmet and, presto, that's Star Anise.

You might be wondering about those weird extra tiles on the side!  I'll get to those in a moment.

With Star Anise drawn, the obvious first thing is to put him on the dang screen.

```lua
function _init()
end

function _update()
end

function _draw()
    cls()
    spr(1, 64, 64, 2, 3)
end
```

Some explanation may be in order.  For starters, a "function" is a block of code that can be used repeatedly.  (But then, this is not a programming tutorial.)  These particular functions are special to the PICO-8: `_init` runs when the cartridge starts, `_update` runs every frame, and `_draw` also runs every frame.

What's a frame, you ask?  Well, you know how movies aren't _really_ showing movement, but are more like a very fast slideshow?  Real life is "continuous" — that is, events occur smoothly over time, so when an object moves, it goes through every point between where it started and where it ends up.  But we have no way to record that motion in full, becuase that would be an infinite amount of information!  The best we can do is take a lot of snapshots very close together.  And it turns out our eyes also work with snapshots (more or less), so it works well enough.

<aside class="aside--well-actually" markdown="1">
Arguably, real life might not be continuous, either.  There's a thing called _Planck time_, the shortest possible meaningful unit of time.  As I understand it, the idea is that all other amounts of time are just a (very large) number of Planck times, and the universe also exists as a series of snapshots.
</aside>

Likewise, _simulating_ continuous behavior is extremely difficult, so video games tend to cheat the same way.  We slice time into thin chunks — also called _frames_ — and during each one, we move everything in the world ahead by that amount of time.  If frames are short enough, you get the illusion that the world is behaving smoothly.  Surprise!  It's all fake.

<aside class="aside--computers-are-bad" markdown="1">
The use of the word “frame” becomes incredibly confusing when dealing with sprite animation, which is also composed of frames (in the movie sense), but those frames may last varying amounts of time, including for multiple frames (in the game sense).  You sometimes hear awful phrases like “a three-frame frame” or something.  I am sorry on behalf of all programmers, who cannot help but reuse words in this way.
</aside>

Modern games can (or should) deal with a varying _frame rate_, where each frame is a slightly (or greatly) different duration for any of myriad reasons.  Since the PICO-8 is a faux-retro console, I'll be using the retro term _tic_.  It means the same thing, but it's sometimes used for older systems where the framerate is reliably fixed, usually because it's tied to (or even enforced by) hardware somewhere.  Here it's just emulated, but, you know, close enough.

Right, so, back to the PICO-8 itself.  Every tic (of which there are 30 per second), the PICO-8 does two things: it calls `_update` to advance the game, then it calls `_draw` to draw the new state of the game to the screen.  You might immediately wonder: why have these be separate if they happen one after the other anyway?  Great question!  The answer is that the PICO-8 does something clever — if it notices that the `_update` + `_draw` combination is taking longer than one tic (and the game is thus starting to lag), it will automatically drop down to 15 FPS.  In this mode, it will call `_update` _twice_ and then call `_draw`.  Here is a terrible ASCII diagram.

```text
        | tic                   | tic                   |
--------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
30 FPS: | _update() _draw()     | _update() _draw()     |
--------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
15 FPS: | _update() _update() _draw()                   |
```

As you can see, the game still updates twice in the same amount of time, so it still _runs_ at the same speed, but it only draws half as often.  With any luck, that saves enough effort that the game can keep running at the intended speed.

All of that is to say: the `_draw` function draws to the screen.

The first thing you (_usually_) want to do in `_draw` is clear the screen, which is accomplished by the charmingly terse `cls()`.  If you don't do this, your game will merrily draw right on top of whatever was on the screen previously: the prompt, a previous game, even the code editor.

After that, I called `spr()` to draw Star Anise.  The usual arguments are `spr(n, x, y)`, where `n` is the sprite number (visible near the middle of the screen in the sprite editor) and `x, y` say where to place him.  He's made up of six tiles, and you might think that drawing six tiles would thus require calling `spr()` six times, but it helpfully takes two more optional arguments: _how many_ tiles to draw, as a single rectangle taken from the spritesheet.  The above code thus draws a 2-by-3 block of tiles, starting from tile 1, at the coordinates (64, 64) — the center of the screen.

As is programming tradition, sprites are drawn from their top-left corner, so the initial tile is the top-left of the rectangle that gets drawn, and the coordinates are where the top-left of the drawn rectangle appears on screen.  Thus, Star Anise appears with his top left "corner" in the middle of the screen.

<div class="prose-full-illustration">
<img src="{static}/media/gamedev-from-scratch/v1-anise.png" alt="Star Anise standing near the middle of the screen, as promised">
</div>

There he is!  How immensely satisfying.  I always try to get _something_ "real" drawing as early as humanly possible.  It helps me feel like I've made some progress, like I'm working on a specific game and have made steps towards making it exist.  This is already, quite clearly, a Star Anise game, but that wouldn't be obvious if I'd started out with rectangles.

Now what?  A good start would be to have him move around a bit.  That's easy enough if I introduce some state.

I do need to check what buttons the player is pressing, which I can do with `btn(b)`, where `b` is the button...  number.  Left is button 0, right is button 1, up is button 2...  but that makes for some unreadable garbage, so instead, let's use a recently-introduced shortcut.  If you hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and press <kbd>U</kbd>, <kbd>D</kbd>, <kbd>L</kbd>, <kbd>R</kbd>, <kbd>O</kbd>, or <kbd>X</kbd>, the PICO-8 will insert a symbol representing that button.  (I will be representing those symbols as ⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️🅾️❎, which is how the PICO-8 stores them on disk.)

That's enough to move him around:

```lua
function _init()
end

local px = 64
local py = 64

function _update()
    if btn(⬆️) then
        py -= 1
    end
    if btn(⬇️) then
        py += 1
    end
    if btn(⬅️) then
        px -= 1
    end
    if btn(➡️) then
        px += 1
    end
end

function _draw()
    cls()
    spr(1, px, py, 2, 3)
end
```

Here I've put his position (still anchored at his top-left) into some variables, and during `_update()` I update them.  (If you're familiar with Lua, you may balk at `+=` and `-=` — these are extensions added by PICO-8, and they save enough space that they're definitely worth it.)

<aside class="aside--look-out" markdown="1">
This code technically has a bug already.  It looks like Star Anise is meant to move at 1 pixel per tic, but if you hold two directions at once, he'll move 1 pixel horizontally _and_ one pixel vertically, for a combined velocity of $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4$ pixels per tic.  That's 40% faster than intended!

This is a common mistake (and a crucial [speedrunning technique in classic Doom](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Straferunning)), but it doesn't matter here — remember, I'm making a _platformer_, so the vertical movement will go away as soon as I have gravity and something for him to stand on.
</aside>
<aside class="aside--look-out" markdown="1">
There's _also_ a problem with units here.  Star Anise's velocity is 1 pixel/tic, a speed.  But `px` is a position, measured in plain pixels.  You can't meaningfully add a speed to a position.  What's happening here is that this code runs once per tic, so it's implicitly multiplying by 1 tic to get 1 pixel, then adding that.

For any other game system, where fractions are easier to deal with and the framerate isn't fixed in stone, I'd probably measure speed in pixels _per second_ (which is much easier to reason about) and have access to a `dt` value indicating how much time has passed since last frame.  Then I could multiply those to get the distance travelled.  Here, though, my life is easier if the numbers are integers, and multiplying by time would mean tacking on `* 1`.  That eats valuable tokens and is more likely to add confusion than clarity, so I've left it off.
</aside>
<aside class="aside--computers-are-bad" markdown="1">
It feels a bit weird to initialize stuff _outside_ of `_init`, the special PICO-8 function that runs when the cartridge first starts.  (Code outside a function also runs when the cartridge starts.  Earlier, in fact!  It _has_ to, because the `function _init()` block is what creates the `_init` function in the first place.)

The reason is, mostly, `local`.  Lua's `local` keyword makes a variable that only exists within the block; without it, variables are _global_ and exist everywhere in your entire program.  But if I used it within `_init`, then `px` and `py` would only exist...  within `_init`.  I'd have to declare them with `local` outside and then assign them inside, and at that point I'm repeating myself for no reason.

So why use it at all, for globals?  Three reasons.  One, it's a good habit to get into with Lua so you don't accidentally make globals in the wrong place.  Two, it clearly marks where a variable was intended to be _created_; if I only wrote `px = 64`, that could also mean I think I'm setting an _existing_ variable called `px`, and using `local` avoids that ambiguity.  And three, it's very slightly faster for complicated reasons.

That said, my insistence on `local` everywhere does create a couple small problems later on, since a `local` variable only exists from that line onwards.

</div>

This is already halfway to being a game — it does something when I press buttons!  Excellent.  But also weird.  This doesn't look like Star Anise is walking around; it looks like he's a static image being dragged by an invisible cursor or something.  A very easy aesthetic improvement would be to make him not moonwalk when moving left.

That's easy enough; the `spr()` function takes two more optional arguments, indicating whether to flip the sprite horizontally and/or vertically.  I can just slap those in when he's moving left.  Or, well, not _quite_ — I want to flip him when the _last direction he moved_ was left.  If he moves left and then stops, or moves left and then up and down, he should still be facing left.

```lua
function _init()
end

local px = 64
local py = 64
local left = false

function _update()
    if btn(⬆️) then
        py -= 1
    end
    if btn(⬇️) then
        py += 1
    end
    if btn(⬅️) then
        px -= 1
        left = true
    end
    if btn(➡️) then
        px += 1
        left = false
    end
end

function _draw()
    cls()
    spr(1, px, py, 2, 3, left)
end
```

<div class="prose-full-illustration">
<img src="{static}/media/gamedev-from-scratch/v1-anise-moving2.gif" alt="Star Anise sliding around the screen, but turning around when moving left">
</div>

Making progress, but obviously he'd look a lot better if he were animated, right?

Which, finally, brings us back to those extra tiles I drew.  They're copies of Star Anise's legs and antenna, lightly edited to look like he's in mid-step.  The legs are sticking out all the way, and the antenna is adjusted to be...  positioned slightly differently, since it's bouncy.  It's a bit rough, but I can touch it up later.

<div class="prose-full-illustration">
<img src="{static}/media/gamedev-from-scratch/v1-anise-walk.gif" alt="Star Anise's walk animation">
</div>

Note that I've crammed as much movement into as little space as possible here.  This is only a two-frame animation, so the leg movement is exaggerated to get the most bang for my buck.  I don't even duplicate the entirety of Star Anise for the other frame; instead, I only copied the tiles that change.  That'll make him more complicated to draw, but it does save me sprite space — remember, I only have 127 tiles available, and 9 of them is already 7% gone.  (Writing more code to save on limited asset space is, in my experience, a pretty common PICO-8 tactic.)

Unfortunately, this makes flipping his sprite somewhat more complicated.  I can't just use that argument to `spr()`, because—  well, I'll get to that in a second.  Here's the updated code.

```lua
local anise_stand = {1, 2, 17, 18, 33, 34}
local anise_jump = {3, 2, 17, 18, 19, 35}

function _init()
end

local t = 0
local px = 64
local py = 64
local left = false
local moving = false

function _update()
    t += 1
    t %= 120

    moving = false
    if btn(⬆️) then
        py -= 1
        moving = true
    end
    if btn(⬇️) then
        py += 1
        moving = true
    end
    if btn(⬅️) then
        px -= 1
        moving = true
        left = true
    end
    if btn(➡️) then
        px += 1
        moving = true
        left = false
    end
end

function _draw()
    cls()

    local pose = anise_stand
    if moving and t % 8 < 4 then
        pose = anise_jump
    end
    local y = py
    local x0 = px
    local dx = 8
    if left then
        dx = -8
        x0 += 8
    end
    local x = x0
    for i = 1, #pose do
        spr(pose[i], x, y, 1, 1, left)
        if i % 2 == 0 then
            x = x0
            y += 8
        else
            x += dx
        end
    end
end
```

That sure got longer in a hurry!  A quick overview:

I've introduced a global called `t` to act as a clock.  I intend to use this for animation and other global cycles, so I don't care about the _actual_ time — that's why I take it mod 120.

If you're not familiar, the `%` (or “modulus”) operator gives you the remainder after division.  It's super duper useful and I wish we taught it as a primitive math operation!  You can think of it like "clock arithmetic" — if it's 9 o'clock and you wait 4 hours, it becomes 1 o'clock, which is the remainder when you divide 9 + 4 by 12.  Or you can think of it as removing all chunks of something — to convert the 24-hour "13 o'clock" to 12-hour, you remove all the 12s, leaving just 1 behind.  Or you can think of it as coiling the entire number line into a circle, so after 11 you wrap around to 0 and start over.  (That's not quite how clocks work, but using 0–11 turns out to be much simpler than using 1–12.)

The upshot here is that `t` will hit 119 and then wrap back around to zero, which is important because PICO-8 numbers can't go any higher than 32767.  If I left it to its own devices, it would still wrap around, but to the more cumbersome -32768.  I don't want a negative clock!

But why 120?  Because I want to be able to divide the clock cycle into smaller animation cycles, and I can only do that evenly if the whole clock's length is a multiple of the smaller cycle's length.  (On a more powerful system, I'd have a more elaborate animation setup, but that would cost more space and code than I'm willing to spend here.)  Consider if I had a clock that wrapped around at 10, and I wanted an animation 3 tics long.  I would use modulo 3 to shrink the clock, resulting in:

<div class="prose-full-illustration">
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="{static}/media/gamedev-from-scratch/v1-clock-cycle.svg"></object>
</div>

Whoops!  Frame 0 will show twice in a row, intermittently, even seemingly at random.  That's not great.  For the best chance of avoiding that problem without having to think too hard about it, I want a clock whose length is divisible by as much stuff as possible — a [highly composite number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_composite_number).  And, of course, 120 is one such number.

<aside class="aside--note-from-future" markdown="1">
It's not an especially good such number, though; it's not even divisible by 7!  I have everything up to 32767 to choose from, so later I will switch to a clock length of 20160.  Not really sure why I don't go with 27720, which is the biggest highly composite number that the PICO-8 can express.

Oh, and after a few rounds of also using `t` as a variable name for a tile id, I'll rename the clock to the much more intuitive...  `clock`.
</aside>

Next, I track whether Star Anise is moving _at all_, so I know whether to play the walk animation.  Note that I always assume he _isn't_ moving, and then correct myself if it turns out he is; otherwise, the new value of `moving` would persist into future tics and he'd never stop.

That brings me to the new drawing code, which is a little tricky, so here it is a bit at a time:

```lua
-- top of the file
local anise_stand = {1, 2, 17, 18, 33, 34}
local anise_jump = {3, 2, 17, 18, 19, 35}

    -- in _draw()
    local pose = anise_stand
    if moving and t % 8 < 4 then
        pose = anise_jump
    end
```

This decides which tiles I'm going to draw.  I can't draw the walking part (which I've called "jump" because it does look like a jump in isolation, and I'll be reusing them for that later) as a single block with `spr()` like before, and I'd like to share the code, so both frames are now assembled from individual tiles.

Note that tiles 1, 2, 17, 18, 33, and 34 are exactly the ones I was drawing in a single `spr()` call before.  (The numbers increase by 16 when jumping to the next row, which makes sense, because each row has 16 tiles in it.)  The other set is similar, but it has the alternate tiles substituted in.

I only want to use the jump tiles if Star Anise is moving, _and_ if `t % 8 < 4`.  That `%` turns my 120-tic clock into an 8-tic clock, then checks if we're in the first half of it.  Essentially: if it's before noon, show the alternate frame; otherwise, show the normal standing frame.

<div class="prose-full-illustration">
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="{static}/media/gamedev-from-scratch/v1-clock-animation.svg"></object>
</div>

The use of a global timer does have some subtle drawbacks here.  If I tap an arrow key to move Star Anise only very briefly, then he may or may not animate, depending on whether the tap happens to be during the "stand" or "jump" intervals.  A more powerful system, where every animation kept track of its own time, would always briefly show him moving.  (On the other hand, this is an interesting aesthetic in its own right that kinda complements the very low-res and exaggerated animation.)

Next I need to draw the tiles, but we've come to the catch I mentioned before.  When I draw Star Anise flipped, I'm now drawing him as a bunch of separate tiles.  If I drew them in the same left-to-right order, then his left side would be flipped, and his right side would be flipped, but the _whole image_ wouldn't be.  Er, just look at this picture.

<div class="prose-full-illustration">
<img src="{static}/media/gamedev-from-scratch/v1-anise-walk-naive-flipped.png" alt="Star Anise's walk frames, flipped one tile at a time">
</div>

See?  The tiles are arranged the same way, but each one is _individually_ flipped, and the result is...  not what I want.  I'll need to also draw the columns in reverse order.  And that's exactly what I do:

``` { .lua linenostart=45 }
    local y = py
    local x0 = px
    local dx = 8
    if left then
        dx = -8
        x0 += 8
    end
```

Here I'm determining the start point and how far apart the tiles are.  The variable names are fairly terse, for a couple of reasons: one, the PICO-8 screen is not very wide, so long variable names make code much harder to read; but also, math code tends to be easier to follow with shorter names anyway.  I've even taken the naming conventions from math — the initial state of a variable is often written with a subscript zero ($x_0$) and a change is written with the Greek letter delta ($\Delta x$), so I've used the ASCII equivalents of those, `x0` and `dx`.

I'm starting from Star Anise's position, of course, and then each tile is 8 pixels right of the previous one...  if he's not flipped.  If he _is_ flipped, I want to move _left_, which will draw the tiles in reverse order.  But that would change where he draws from, so to compensate, I also start drawing 8 pixels right of where I usually would.  (Try to convince yourself that this is correct; on a flipped Star Anise, tile number 1 should draw 8 pixels left from his upper-left corner.)

``` { .lua linenostart=52 }
    local x = x0
    for i = 1, #pose do
        spr(pose[i], x, y, 1, 1, left)
        if i % 2 == 0 then
            x = x0
            y += 8
        else
            x += dx
        end
    end
```

All that's left to do is the drawing itself.  For each tile in the `pose` list, I draw that tile.  Each row is two tiles wide, so after every second tile, I reset the horizontal "cursor" (`x`) back to where it started and move down by one row's worth of pixels.  For any other tile, I just move horizontally by `dx`.

The results are basically magic.

And that's a good place to pause for now.  Yes, I know, we didn't get very far, but this _is_ part zero!  It's mostly a test of this series and its tone for me, and a test of fortitude for you.  I hope you could follow along with the minor mathematical hijinks above, because next time it gets _much_ worse — before I can do anything else at all, I have to write _collision detection_.  Oh boy!  Stay tuned!  And always feel free to ask questions, of me or anyone else!

## Appendix: PICO-8 Lua extensions

Here are all the modifications PICO-8 has made to the language (based on Lua 5.2).  If you've never used Lua, keep in mind that these won't carry over if you try to write Lua anywhere else.  Some of these are advanced features, so if you have no idea what something means, that's probably fine.

Spoilers: it's mostly that the standard library has changed.

* Numbers are signed 15.16 fixed-point, rather than stock Lua's 64-bit floating point.  That means fractions can only be represented in increments of 0.0000152587890625 (= $2^{-16}$, a cumbersome number I refer to as the "Planck size"), and numbers can't exceed ±32768.

* Compound assignment is supported: `a += b` works as in `a = a + b` in stock Lua, where `+` can be replaced with any binary operator.

* `!=` is allowed as an alias for `~=`.

* `if (foo) bar = 1` is shorthand for `if foo then bar = 1 end`.  The parentheses are required, and the condition ends at the end of the line.  (I strongly advise against using this unless you're very desperate for space; it scans poorly and doesn't even save tokens.)

* The new `@`, `%`, and `$` unary prefix operators read 1, 2, or 4 bytes from a memory address.  (PICO-8's memory, not system RAM!)

* The `?` unary prefix operator is equivalent to `print`.  (I've never used it, and it's not even directly documented.)

* The built-in functions `collectgarbage`, `dofile`, `error`, `pcall`, `require`, `select`, and `xpcall` are not available (though the lack of `select` might be a bug).

    The built-in variables `_G` and `_VERSION` are not available.

    `load` has been replaced with a function that loads PICO-8 carts from files.

    `print` has been replaced with a drawing function, which prints a single string at a position on screen.

    `tonumber` and `tostring` have been replaced with `tonum` and `tostr`, which behave slightly differently (but `tostr` does still respect the `__tostring` metatable field).

    (`assert`, `getmetatable`, `ipairs`, `next`, `pairs`, `rawequal`, `rawget`, `rawlen`, `rawset`, `setmetatable`, and `type` still exist and work as in stock Lua.)

* The `coroutine` library is not available, but most of its contents are exposed directly as `cocreate`, `coresume`, `costatus`, and `yield`.  There is no equivalent for `coroutine.running` or `coroutine.wrap`.

* The `require` function and `package` library are not available, though the `#include` syntax can be used to textually substitute the contents of a Lua file.

* The `string` library is not available.  Replacement string functions are: `chr`, `ord`, `split`, and `sub`.

* The `table` library is not available.  Replacement table functions are: `add`, `del`, `deli`, `count`, `all`, `foreach`.  There is no built-in way to concatenate or sort a list.

* The `math` library is not available.  Replacement math functions are: `max`, `min`, `mid`, `flr`, `ceil`, `sin`, `cos`, `atan2`, `sqrt`, `abs`, `rnd`, `srand`.  There is also an integer division operator, `\`.

* The `bit32` library is not available, but bitwise operations are available as both functions — `band`, `bor`, `bxor`, `bnot`, `shl`, `shr`, `lshr`, `rotl`, `rotr` — and operators — `&`, `|`, `^^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`, `<<>`, `>><`.

* The `io` library is not available.  Running PICO-8 cartridges have no notion of a filesystem.

* The `os` library is not available.  Running PICO-8 cartridges have no direct access to the underlying operating system.  (Some facilities are exposed through the "syscall" function `stat`, such as accessing the current UTC or local time.)

* The `debug` library is not available.

* A number of other new functions were added, though I won't list them all here; they're generally for drawing, working with assets, or interacting with the PICO-8's faux hardware.
